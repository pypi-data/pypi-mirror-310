- Run `bwm` or bind to keystroke combination.

  in config.ini.

  `{USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}`.

## Features

- *General features*
    - Compatible with both [Bitwarden.com](https://bitwarden.com) and
      self-hosted [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garci/vaultwarden)
      accounts. Accounts can be switched on the fly.
    - Alternate keyboard languages and layouts supported via xdotool, ydotool or
      wtype (for Wayland)
    - Add, edit and type TOTP codes. RFC 6238, Steam and custom settings are
      supported.
- *Type entries*
    - Auto-type username and/or password on selection. Use xdotool, ydotool, or
      wtype for non-U.S. English keyboard layout.
    - Select to clipboard if desired (clears clipboard after 30s on X11 or after
      one paste on Wayland). If `view/type individual entries` isn't selected
      first, it will copy the password field to the clipboard if it exists,
      otherwise will raise an error.
    - Use a custom [Keepass 2.x style auto-type sequence][1] if you have one
      defined
      (except for character repetition and the 'special commands'). Set it per entry
      or set a global default. Disable autotype for an entry, if desired.
    - Select any single field and have it typed into the active window. Notes fields
      can be viewed line-by-line and the selected line will be typed when
      selected.
    - `Enter` to open the URL in the default web browser from the View/Type menu.
- *Edit*
    - Edit entry title, username, URL and password (manually typed or auto-generate)
    - Edit notes using terminal or gui editor (set in config.ini, or uses $EDITOR)
    - Add and Delete entries
    - Rename, move, delete and add folders
    - Collection management:
        - Add, remove, rename, delete collections
        - Add item to collection(s) (multiple collections supported)
        - Move item from collection back to personal vault
- *Configure* ([docs](configure.md))
    - Prompts for and saves initial vault URL and login if config file isn't
      setup before first run.
    - Set multiple vaults and logins in the config file.
    - Hide selected groups from the default and 'View/Type Individual entries' views.
    - Bitwarden-menu runs in the background after initial startup and will retain the
      entered passphrase for `session_timeout_min` minutes after the last activity.
    - Configure the characters and groups of characters used during password
      generation in the config file (see config.ini.example for instructions).
      Multiple character sets can be selected on the fly when using Rofi if the
      `-multi-select` option is passed via `dmenu_command`.
    - Optional Pinentry support for secure passphrase entry.
