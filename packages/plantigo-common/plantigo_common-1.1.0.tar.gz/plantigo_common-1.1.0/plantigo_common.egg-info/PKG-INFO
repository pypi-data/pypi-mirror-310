# Plantigo Common

Welcome to the **Plantigo Common** repository. This repository contains reusable packages and shared components for the Plantigo project.

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to centralize common code that can be shared across multiple services and applications within the Plantigo ecosystem. By doing so, we aim to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

## Packages

The library consists of the following packages:

* **django** - Django-specific utilities and extensions:
  * `proto_serializer.py` - Serializers for working with Protocol Buffers in Django

* **python/auth** - Authentication and authorization components:
  * `token_service.py` - Service for token management and validation

* **python/grpc** - gRPC-related utilities and infrastructure:
  * `auth_interceptor.py` - Authentication interceptor for gRPC calls
  * `rpc_caller.py` - Implementation for making gRPC service calls

The packages provide reusable components focused on Django integration, authentication handling, and gRPC communication infrastructure that can be shared across different Plantigo services.
