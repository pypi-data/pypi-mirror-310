# TorboxApi Python SDK 1.0.0<a id="torboxapi-python-sdk-100"></a>

Welcome to the TorboxApi SDK documentation. This guide will help you get started with integrating and using the TorboxApi SDK in your project.

## Versions<a id="versions"></a>

- API version: `1.0.0`
- SDK version: `1.0.0`

## About the API<a id="about-the-api"></a>

### Full documentation for TorBox Current API Base: `https://api.torbox.app` Current API Version: `v1` You can find more API docs here: [http://api.torbox.app/docs](http://api.torbox.app/docs) (they aren't as great as these, but is in a format most people would be familiar to). ### General Information - You can rely on both `success` booleans or status codes to determine if a call was a success. Status code `200` always means a success. `403` means authentication error. `500` means something went wrong on TorBox's end. `400` means the user did something wrong, or an input wasn't correct, or expected. - There will always be a user-friendly message in `detail` for a reason why a call was a failure, or a success message. You may forward these directly to users. - The `/usenet` and the `/webdl` API endpoints are nearly the same as the `/torrents` API endpoints apart from some different named inputs and outputs. - All outputs are JSON unless otherwise specified. Check out the examples to be sure. ### Rate Limits - Unless stated below, all endpoints are rate limited to **5/sec** per IP, no edge rate limiting. - `POST` /torrents/createtorrent is rate limited to **50/hour** per IP and **10/min** at edge. - `POST` /usenet/createusenetdownload is rate limited to **25/hour** per IP and **10/min** at edge. - `POST` /webdl/createwebdownload is rate limited to **25/hour** per IP and **10/min** at edge. - If you have a specific application, please contact us with your IP and reason to get unlimited requests. ### Standard Response `json {      success : boolean, // whether a response is successful or not      error : string, // an error code if there was an error, or null if success      detail : string, // a user-friendly message      data : any // usually an object/dict, but can be anything, check the examples }  ` ### Errors Table Errors codes are part of the standard response type. If the code ends in ERROR , the error is the server's fault else that error is something that the client caused. | **Error Code** | Error Meaning | | --- | --- | | DATABASE*ERROR | Could not access internal database/memory store information. | | UNKNOWN_ERROR | The reason for the error is unknown. Usually there will be error data attached in the data key. In these cases please report the request to [contact@torbox.app](https://mailto:contact@torbox.app). | | NO_AUTH | There are no provided credentials. | | BAD_TOKEN | The provided token is invalid. | | AUTH_ERROR | There was an error verifying the given authentication. | | INVALID_OPTION | The provided option is invalid. | | REDIRECT_ERROR | The server tried redirecting, but it faulted. | | OAUTH_VERIFICATION_ERROR | The server tried verifying your OAuth token, but it was not accepted by the provider. | | ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND | If you have hit an endpoint that doesn't exist. | | ITEM_NOT_FOUND | The item you queried cannot be found. | | PLAN_RESTRICTED_FEATURE | This feature is restricted to users of higher plans. The user is recommended to upgrade their plan to use this endpoint. | | DUPLICATE_ITEM | This item already exists. | | BOZO_RSS_FEED | This RSS feed is invalid or not a well-formed XML. | | SELLIX_ERROR | There was an error with the Sellix API. Usually in the case of payments. | | TOO_MUCH_DATA | Client sent too much data to the API. Please keep requests under 100MB in size. | | DOWNLOAD_TOO_LARGE | This download is oversized for the user's plan. The user is recommended to upgrade their plan to download this file. <br> <br>Free Plan Limit: **10737418240** bytes <br>Essential Plan Limit: **214748364800** bytes <br>Standard Plan Limit: **214748364800** bytes <br>Pro Plan Limit: **536870912000** bytes | | MISSING_REQUIRED_OPTION | The API is missing required information to process the request. | | TOO_MANY_OPTIONS | Client sent too many options. Usually this has to do with the API requiring only 1 option but the client sent more than the required. | | BOZO_TORRENT | The torrent sent is not a valid torrent. | | NO_SERVERS_AVAILABLE_ERROR | There are no download servers available to handle this request. This should never happen. If you receieve this error, please contact us at [contact@torbox.app](https://mailto:contact@torbox.app). | | MONTHLY_LIMIT | User has hit the maximum monthly limit. It is recommended user upgrade their account to be able to download more. | | COOLDOWN_LIMIT | User is on download cooldown. It is recommended user upgrade their account to be able to bypass this restriction. | | ACTIVE_LIMIT | User has hit their max active download limit. It is recommended user upgrade their account or purchase addons to bypass this restriction. | | DOWNLOAD_SERVER_ERROR | There was an error interacting with the download on the download server. It is recommdned to simply wait some time before trying again. | | BOZO_NZB | The NZB sent is not a valid NZB file. | | SEARCH_ERROR | There was an error searching using the TorBox Search API. | | INVALID_DEVICE | The client is sending requests from the incorrect device. | | DIFF_ISSUE | The request parameters sent does not allow for this request to complete. | | LINK_OFFLINE | The link given is inaccessible or has no online files. | | VENDOR_DISABLED | This vendor account has been disabled. Please contact support. | | BOZO_REGEX | The regex you entered is bad. | ### Translation to Real-Debrid API Useful for if you want to add TorBox to an app where Real-Debrid is already existing. These are the API routes that are nearly the same with Real-Debrid API routes. You will have to change things such as parameters and check outputs as they both are not the same. You can find docs to Real-Debrid's API [here](https://api.real-debrid.com/). | Real-Debrid API Routes | TorBox API Routes | | --- | --- | | `GET` /torrents | `GET` /torrents/mylist | | `GET` /torrents/info/{id} | `GET` /torrents/mylist?id={id} | | `GET` /torrents/instantAvailability/{hash} | `GET` /torrents/checkcached | | `PUT` /torrents/addTorrent | `POST` /torrents/createtorrent | | `POST` /torrents/addMagnet | `POST` /torrents/createtorrent | | `POST` /torrents/selectFiles/{id} | **None**, \_not needed. Torrents will download all files. This will not be changed.* | | `DELETE` /torrents/delete/{id} | `POST` /torrents/controltorrent | | `POST` /unrestrict/link | `GET` /torrents/requestdl | ### Dates All dates returned from the API are normalized to UTC time. All dates are in the format: `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` Example: `2024-10-21T20:47:03Z` = The 21st of October, 2024 at 8:47:03 PM UTC. This makes it easy for users and integrations to parse these dates and change them to the user's time zone for better UX.

## Setup & Configuration<a id="setup--configuration"></a>

### Supported Language Versions<a id="supported-language-versions"></a>

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `Python >= 3.7`

### Installation<a id="installation"></a>

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torbox_api
```

## Authentication<a id="authentication"></a>

### Access Token Authentication<a id="access-token-authentication"></a>

The TorboxApi API uses an Access Token for authentication.

This token must be provided to authenticate your requests to the API.

#### Setting the Access Token<a id="setting-the-access-token"></a>

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the access token as follows:

```py
TorboxApi(
    access_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    timeout=10000
)
```

If you need to set or update the access token after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```py
sdk.set_access_token("YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN")
```

## Setting a Custom Timeout<a id="setting-a-custom-timeout"></a>

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```py
from torbox_api import TorboxApi

sdk = TorboxApi(timeout=10000)
```

# Sample Usage<a id="sample-usage"></a>

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```py
from torbox_api import TorboxApi

sdk = TorboxApi(
    access_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    timeout=10000
)

result = sdk.general.get_up_status()

print(result)

```

## Services<a id="services"></a>

The SDK provides various services to interact with the API.

</details>

### Using Union Types<a id="using-union-types"></a>

Union types allow you to specify that a variable can have more than one type. This is particularly useful when a function can accept multiple types of inputs. The Union type hint is used for this purpose.

#### Example Function with Union Types<a id="example-function-with-union-types"></a>

You can call service method with an instance of `TypeA`, `TypeB`, or a dictionary that can be converted to an instance of either type.

```python
# Model Definition<a id="model-definition"></a>
ParamType = Union[TypeA, TypeB]

# Service Method<a id="service-method"></a>
def service_method(param: ParamType):
...

## Usage<a id="usage"></a>
type_a = TypeA(key="value")
type_b = TypeB(key="value")

sdk.service.service_method(type_a)
sdk.service.service_method(type_b)
sdk.service.service_method({"key": "value"})
```

You cannot create an instance of a `Union` type itself. Instead, pass an instance of one of the types in the `Union`, or a dictionary that can be converted to one of those types.
