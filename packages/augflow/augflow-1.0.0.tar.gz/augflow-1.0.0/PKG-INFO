## 👾 Features
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

  **Discover What Makes AugFlow Unique and So Powerful 🌟**

- **🌊 Innovative Flow Concept**
    AugFlow introduces the entirely novel concept of flows, a groundbreaking approach not yet implemented in any existing theory or solutions. Our initial evaluations demonstrate the impact and advantages this unique methodology brings to data augmentation.

- **🛠️ Configurable Parameters**: Every augmentation is fully configurable through simple and intuitive parameters.

- **🖍️ Comprehensive Polygon Clipping Control**
    Unlike existing open and closed-source solutions that inadequately manage polygon clipping, AugFlow offers comprehensive, per-class control over clipped polygons, enhancing dataset diversity especially for those with high intra-class variability.

- **✂️ Enhanced CutOut Functionality**
    AugFlow's CutOut feature provides superior control, enabling precise targeting of large or small polygons along with customizable parameters. This flexibility ensures more effective and tailored data augmentation strategies.

- **🧩 Advanced Mosaic Augmentation**
    AugFlow's Mosaic augmentation offers exceptional control with dynamic grid configurations, including larger grids for high-resolution images. This adaptability significantly improves detection accuracy for small objects within complex scenes.

- **🔄 Precise Transformation Controls**
    AugFlow enhances fundamental augmentations like Crop, Rotate, Shear, and Translate, allowing precise customization to better suit diverse dataset requirements and improve model robustness.

- **🎯 Targeted Category Focusing**
    AugFlow enables targeted augmentation by focusing on images containing specific categories while excluding others, effectively balancing datasets. Future enhancements aim to handle edge cases per class using advanced unsupervised techniques.

- **📄 Format-Agnostic**: Supports multiple annotation formats including **COCO** and **YOLO** seamlessly, for both detection and segmentation.

- **📊 Logging & Visualization**: Track augmentation processes with detailed logs and visualize annotations to ensure quality.

- **🔧 Extensible Architecture**: Designed to easily incorporate new augmentations and extend existing functionalities.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ☑️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python Version:** Python 3.6 or higher
- **Package Manager:** [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed
- **Git:** Installed for cloning the repository and contributing ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))



### ⚙️ Installation

🛠️ Setting Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv augflow-env
    ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    - **Windows:**

      ```bash
      augflow-env\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - **macOS and Linux:**

      ```bash
      source augflow-env/bin/activate
      ```


After creating your virtual env you can **Install AugFlow** using one of the following methods:

1. **Build from source:**


    - Clone the augflow repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/ConnectedMotion/augflow.git
        ```

    - Navigate to the project directory:
        ```bash
        cd augflow
        ```


    - Install the project dependencies:

        ```bash
        pip install -e .
        ```

2. **Or. Install directly using &nbsp; [<img align="center" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Pip-3776AB.svg?style={badge_style}&logo=pypi&logoColor=white" />](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)**

 ```bash
    pip install augflow
 ```

### 🎯 Quick Start Example

The following example demonstrates how to use AugFlow's Pipeline to apply a tree of augmentations to a YOLO-formatted dataset. This pipeline includes rotations, translations, mosaics, crops, and cutouts to enhance the diversity and robustness of a vehicle damage segmentation dataset. After running your experiment, you will receive detailed logs about the flow, saved in the **augflow_pipeline.log** file.

  ```bash
    
import copy

from augflow.pipeline import Pipeline
import augflow.utils.configs as config

# Define the experiment identifier
experiment_id = 'your_experiment_id'

# Initialize the AugFlow pipeline
pipe = Pipeline()

# Configure the pipeline task for YOLO format, specifying the dataset path containing images and labels
pipe.task(
    format='yolo',
    dataset_path='your_dataset_path'
)

# Apply default rotation augmentations to the original dataset
pipe.fuse(source_id='root', type='rotate', id='aug_rotate')

# Apply translation augmentations and merge them into the final output
pipe.fuse(source_id='root', type='translate', id='aug_translate', merge=True)

# Create a 2x2 mosaic of rotated images with output dimensions of 1280x1280 pixels
pipe.fuse(
    source_id='aug_rotate',
    type='mosaic',
    id='mosaic_2by2',
    output_dim=(1280, 1280),
    merge=True
)

# Crop only the mosaic images that contain all polygons with their area exceeding 0.5% of the original image's area
pipe.fuse(
    source_id='mosaic_2by2',
    type='crop',
    min_relative_area=0.005,
    merge=True
)

# Customize the mosaic configuration to create a 4x4 grid by copying and modifying the default settings
mosaic_4by4 = copy.deepcopy(config.mosaic_default_config)
mosaic_4by4['grid_size'] = (4, 4)

# Apply the customized 4x4 mosaic augmentations and merge them into the final output
pipe.fuse(
    source_id='root',
    type='mosaic',
    config=mosaic_4by4,
    merge=True
)

# Apply cutout augmentations targeting images containing only objects from the 'scratch' class
pipe.fuse(
    source_id='root',
    type='cutout',
    focus={'include': ['scratch'], 'exclude': 'all_others'},
    merge=True
)

# Define the output configuration for the pipeline, specifying YOLO format and the destination path
pipe.out(
    format='yolo',
    output_path=f'your_outpath_path/{experiment_id}',
    ignore_masks=False,
    visualize_annotations=True
)


  ```
