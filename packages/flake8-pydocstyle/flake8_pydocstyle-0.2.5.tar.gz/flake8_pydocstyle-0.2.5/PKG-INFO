# flake8-pydocstyle

The project is ARCHIVED, and it is no longer actively maintained.

I have stopped using `pydocstyle` and substituted it with [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff). Moreover [`pydocstyle`](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle/) project has been deprecated and is no longer actively maintained.

## Description

Plugin for [`flake8`](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) that runs [`pydocstyle`](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle/) while linting.

It is running `pydocstyle` as it would be run without any parameters in the command line, so it respects all configuration file options that you can set for example in `pyproject.toml`.

## Reason

Maybe you ask a question why just not use [`flake8-docstrings`](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-docstrings). In my use-case I wanted to keep the configuration in the `pyproject.toml` file and be able to use everything that `pydocstyle` has to offer in terms of customization. The `flake8-docstrings` is not reading the `pydocstyle` config files, but provides its own options which was insufficient to me.
