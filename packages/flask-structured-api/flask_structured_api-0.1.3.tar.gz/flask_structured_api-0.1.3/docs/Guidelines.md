# Documentation Writing Guidelines

## Core Principles
1. **Start with Purpose**
   - Begin with a clear, concise explanation of what the system does
   - List practical use cases early
   - Avoid marketing language or superlatives

2. **Structure Flow**
   - Quick start → Basic concepts → Detailed features → Advanced usage
   - Each section should build on previous knowledge
   - Use clear headings and subheadings for navigation

3. **Code Examples**
   - Start with simple, complete examples
   - Show real-world scenarios (like AI endpoints)
   - Include both request and response examples
   - Add brief comments to explain key points

4. **Language Style**
   - Use conversational tone for introductions and transitions
   - Keep technical details precise and clear
   - Write in active voice
   - Avoid jargon unless necessary

5. **Formatting**
   ```markdown
   # Main Section
   Brief introduction paragraph explaining the section's purpose.

   ## Subsection
   Detailed explanation with context.

   ### Implementation
   ```python
   # Clear, practical example
   @decorator
   def example():
      """Docstring explaining purpose"""
      return result
   ```

6. **Content Elements**
   - Bulleted lists for features and options
   - Code blocks with language specification
   - JSON examples for API requests/responses
   - Tips and warnings in clearly marked sections
   - Troubleshooting sections for common issues

7. **AI-Friendly Structure**
   - Use consistent heading levels
   - Keep related content together
   - Use standard markdown formatting
   - Include clear section transitions
   - Maintain consistent terminology

@decorator
def example():
    return result
```

## Core Features

- List key capabilities
- Keep it concise
- Link to detailed sections

## Detailed Usage

### Basic Implementation
Explain the simplest way to use the feature.

### Advanced Options
Show configuration and customization.

### Integration
How to combine with other features.

## API Reference

# Example Documentation Outline: Authentication System

Here's a model outline for documenting a core feature:

```markdown
# Authentication System

The authentication system provides secure user identification and access control for API endpoints. It supports both JWT tokens and API keys, with optional rate limiting and permission scoping.

## Common Use Cases

- Web applications needing secure user sessions
- Mobile apps requiring long-lived API keys
- Service-to-service authentication
- Multi-factor authentication flows

## Quick Start

Here's a basic example of protecting an endpoint:

```python
from flask_structured_api.core.auth import require_auth

@app.route('/profile')
@require_auth
def get_profile():
    return {"user": current_user.to_dict()}
```

## Core Features

- JWT-based authentication
- API key support
- Role-based access control
- Rate limiting
- Session management

## Authentication Methods

### JWT Tokens
Explain JWT implementation with example request/response.

### API Keys
Show API key usage with example code.

## Security Considerations
List important security notes.

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions.
```

Key elements that make this outline effective:
1. Clear purpose statement
2. Immediate practical examples
3. Progressive complexity
4. Mix of explanatory text and code
5. Security and troubleshooting sections
