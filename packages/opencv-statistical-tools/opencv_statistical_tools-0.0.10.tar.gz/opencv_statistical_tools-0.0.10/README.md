# OpenCV Homography Utility
This Python library provides a simplified and powerful interface for working with homography transformations using OpenCV. It is designed for tasks like perspective transformations, image stitching, planar mapping, and object alignment. The library abstracts complex OpenCV functionality into user-friendly methods for developers and researchers.

Features

Compute homography matrix from corresponding points.
Apply perspective transformations to images.
Visualize transformed images with overlays.
Error calculation and optimization for homography accuracy.
Export and import homography matrices for reuse.
