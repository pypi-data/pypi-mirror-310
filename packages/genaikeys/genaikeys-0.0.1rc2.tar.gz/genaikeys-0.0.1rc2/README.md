# GenAIKeys [WIP]

GenAIKeys is a Python library that streamlines API key management for Generative AI applications by securely
storing the keys in cloud secret vaults like [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/), 
[AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/), and [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager).

> **Disclaimer**: Please exercise caution when using this package in production environments. We recommend that you
> review the codebase and ensure that it meets your security requirements before deploying it in a production environment.

## Features

- üîê Secure API key management for GenAI services
- üöÄ Zero environment variable configuration
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Direct integration with cloud secret vaults
- üîå Built-in support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini
- üõ† Extensible architecture for custom secret backends

## Installation

```bash
pip install genaikeys
```

## Quick Start

```python
from genaikeys import SecretKeeper

# Initialize GenAIKeys
skp = SecretKeeper.from_defaults()

# Get API keys directly
api_key = skp.get('huggingface-api-key')

# Use convenience methods
openai_key = skp.get_openai_key()
anthropic_key = skp.get_anthropic_key()
gemini_key = skp.get_gemini_key()
```

## Configuration

* By default, GenAIKeys uses the `Azure Key Vault` secret backend. You can configure the secret backend by setting
  the `SECRET_KEEPER_BACKEND` environment variable to one of the following values:
    - `AZURE`
    - `AWS`
    - `GCP`
* We recommend setting the `SECRET_KEEPER_BACKEND` environment variable in a persistent configuration file like
  `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.*

* You will also need to provide the configurations for the secret backend you choose.

#### Azure Key Vault

- The following environment variables are required for the `Azure Key Vault` secret backend:
    - `AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URL`
- Optionally you can also provide the following environment variables:
    - `MANGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID` (for User Assigned Managed Identity authentication)
