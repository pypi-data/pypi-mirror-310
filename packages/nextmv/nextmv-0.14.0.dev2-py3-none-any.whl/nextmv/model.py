class Model(PythonModel):
    """
    Model is the base class for defining a decision model that runs in Nextmv
    Cloud. You must create a subclass of this class and implement the `solve`
    method. The `solve` method is the main entry point of your model and should
    return an output with a solution (decision).

    Example
    -------
    ```python
    import nextroute

    import nextmv


    # Define the model that makes decisions. This model uses the Nextroute library
    # to solve a routing problem.
    class DecisionModel(nextmv.Model):

            nextroute_options = nextroute.Options.extract_from_dict(options.to_dict())
            nextroute_output = nextroute.solve(nextroute_input, nextroute_options)
