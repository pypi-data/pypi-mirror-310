Introduction

What is PUNCH?
--------------
PUNCH is a NASA Small Explorer (SMEX) mission to better understand how the mass and energy of
the Sunâ€™s corona become the solar wind that fills the solar system.
Four suitcase-sized satellites will work together to produce images of the entire inner solar system around the clock.
You can learn more at the `PUNCH website <https://punch.space.swri.edu/>`_.

Where does `punchbowl` fit in?
--------------------------------------
``punchbowl`` is the data reduction pipeline code for the PUNCH mission. The pipeline, as shown below,
consists of several segments of processing.

    This is a schematic of the pipeline.


These segments are the following:

- Raw to *Level 0*: converts raw satellite data to FITS images
- Level 0 to *Level 1*: basic image calibration
- Level 1 to *Level 2*: polarization resolution, image merging, quality marking
- Level 2 to *Level 3*: background subtraction

We identify these segments by their finishing level, i.e. the Level 1 products come from the Level 0 to Level 1 segment
which can be called just the Level 1 segment for short. The processing description and code you'll find here is
organized in this manner.
