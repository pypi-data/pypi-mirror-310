Griffe FastAPI Extension
========================

This extension will search for functions that are decorated with an APIRouter and adds the following extra
fields to a function:

+ api: the path of the api
+ method: the HTTP method
+ responses: A dictionary with the responses

These fields are stored in the extra property of the function. The extra property is a dictionary and `griffe_fastapi`
is the key for the fields of this extension.

A fastapi template is used to handle these extra fields in your documentation.
