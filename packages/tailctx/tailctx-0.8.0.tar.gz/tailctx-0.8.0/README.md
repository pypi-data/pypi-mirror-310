# tailctx - Tailscale context manager

`tailctx` is a tool to help manage several environment for your Tailscale VPNs.

Traditionally, Tailscale only supports connecting to one login server, requiring to delete the state in order to connect to another one, which makes it unpractical when having several separate corporate environments, or a corporate and personal VPNS. `tailctx` runs `tailscaled` with a separate state directory, stored in the user's home directory, in order to persist the distinct states.

Once a context is launched, it can be used and configured as any other Tailscale connection, though the `tailscale` command.
