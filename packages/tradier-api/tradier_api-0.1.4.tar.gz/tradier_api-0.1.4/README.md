# Tradier API Python Library

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/tradier-api.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/tradier-api/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A Python library for interacting with the [Tradier API](https://tradier.com/). This library simplifies access to Tradier's market data, trading functionalities, and account management features.

---

## Features

- **Market Data:** Retrieve historical and real-time market data, including OHLC and volume.
- **Account Management:** Access account balances, positions, and trading history.
- **Order Management:** Place, modify, and cancel orders programmatically.
- **Streaming:** Utilize Tradier's WebSocket API for live market data.
- **Environment Switching:** Easily toggle between sandbox and live environments.
- **Built-in Rate-Limiting:** Rate limits enforced internally by the library code.

## Installation

Install the library using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tradier-api
```
---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.6 or higher.
2. An active [Tradier API account](https://tradier.com/).
3. A `_secrets.py` file containing your API tokens and account numbers:
   ```python
   TRADIER_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_LIVE_API_TOKEN"
   TRADIER_API_ACCOUNT = "YOUR_LIVE_ACCOUNT_NUMBER"   
   TRADIER_SANDBOX_TOKEN = "YOUR_SANDBOX_API_TOKEN"
   TRADIER_SANDBOX_ACCT = "YOUR_SANDBOX_ACCOUNT_NUMBER"
   ```

   **Note:** `_secrets.py` is excluded from version control to ensure security.

### Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of fetching historical market data:

```python
from tradier_api import LiveConfig, TradierApiController, Endpoints
from _secrets import TRADIER_API_TOKEN

# Initialize the Tradier API with your live token
config = LiveConfig(token=TRADIER_API_TOKEN)
api_controller = TradierApiController(config)

# Fetch historical data for SPY
historical_data = api_controller.make_request(
    endpoint=Endpoints.GET_HISTORICAL_PRICES,
    query_params={
        "symbol": "SPY",
        "interval": "daily",
        "start": "2023-01-01",
        "end": "2023-12-31",
    },
)

# Print the historical data
print(historical_data)
```

## Class Hierarchy

```
+--- TradierAPIException: Custom exception class for handling errors specific to the Tradier API.  
|  
+-- TradierConfig: Manages API configuration, including environment selection and headers.  
|   +-- LiveConfig:                 Configures the API for live production usage.  
|   +-- SandboxConfig:              Configures the API for sandbox (testing) environment usage.  
|   +-- PaperConfig:                Alias for SandobxConfig (paper-trading) type.    
|  
+-- TradierBaseController: Base controller class for shared logic across Tradier API controllers.  
|   +-- TradierApiController:       Main controller for interacting with Tradier REST API endpoints.  
|   +-- TradierStreamController:    Handles configuration and session control for streaming data connections.  
|  
+-- TradierBaseStreamer: Base class for implementing HTTP and WebSocket streaming functionality.  
|   +-- TradierHttpStreamer:        Provides functionality for HTTP-based streaming of market data or events.  
|   +-- TradierWebsocketStreamer:   Implements WebSocket-based streaming for live market and account data.  
|       +-- TradierMarketsStreamer: Specializes in market-specific data streams (e.g., quotes, trades).
