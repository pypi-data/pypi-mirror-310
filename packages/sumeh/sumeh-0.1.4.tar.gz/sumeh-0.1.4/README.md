# Sumeh - Quality Check and Config Management Tool

Sumeh is a tool designed to simplify the parameterization of the `cuallee` project. It provides an efficient way to retrieve configurations from various sources, such as `CSV files`, `S3`, `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, and `BigQuery`, and also offers features to validate these configurations based on defined rules.

## Purpose

The main goal of **Sumeh** is to streamline the collection of configurations for the **Cuallee** project, providing a configurator that can access and validate data from different sources, along with a series of quality checks to ensure the data meets the expected standards.

## Features

- **Configuration Collection**: Supports collecting configurations from multiple sources, including S3, MySQL, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, and CSV.
- **Data Validation**: Allows applying a series of validation rules to the collected data, including checks for completeness, uniqueness, or whether values meet a specific threshold.
- **Quality Check Facilitator**: Through integration with Cuallee, it is possible to perform checks like "is_complete," "is_unique," "is_greater_than," among others, to ensure data quality.

## Features

- **Configuration Retrieval**: Fetch configuration data from various sources:
  - Amazon S3
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - BigQuery
  - CSV files

- **Quality Check**: Run quality checks on data using customizable rules:
  - Ensure completeness
  - Check uniqueness
  - Validate primary keys
  - Verify value ranges (greater than, less than, equal to)
  - And more!

- **Configurable Rules**: Define checks such as `is_complete`, `is_unique`, `is_primary_key`, and more, with flexible parameters like threshold values and value ranges.

## Installation

To get started with the project

```bash
pip install sumeh
```

## Usage

The main entry point is the sumeh.py script, which provides various utilities for working with configuration data and performing quality checks. You can also use the CLI for interacting with the configurator.

Each test corresponds to a specific check that can be applied to a dataset, using the rules defined in the code.

## Configuration Retrieval
You can retrieve configuration data using the following methods:

- #### From S3:
```python
from sumeh import get_config_from_s3
rules = get_config_from_s3("s3://bucket/path/to/file.csv")
```

- #### From MySQL:
```python
from sumeh import get_config_from_mysql

rules = get_config_from_mysql(
    host="localhost", user="root", password="password", database="test_db", table="config_table"
)
```
- #### From PostgreSQL:
```python
from sumeh import get_config_from_postgresql

rules = get_config_from_postgresql(
    host="localhost", user="user", password="password", database="test_db", table="config_table"
)
```

- #### From BigQuery:
```python
from sumeh import get_config_from_bigquery

rules = get_config_from_bigquery(
    project_id="your_project_id", dataset_id="your_dataset", table_id="your_table"
)
```
- #### From CSV:
```python
from sumeh import get_config_from_csv

rules = get_config_from_csv("path/to/config.csv")
```

### Running Quality Checks
Once you have the configuration data, you can apply quality checks using the quality() function:

```python
from sumeh import quality

rules = [
    {"check_type": "is_complete", "field": "column_name", "threshold": 0.9},
    {"check_type": "is_unique", "field": "id_column"}
]
# any dataframe: pyspark | pandas | bigquery
result = quality(df, rules)
result.show()
```

### CLI Usage
You can also interact with the project through the command-line interface (CLI) provided by cli.py. To get started with the CLI, run:
```bash
sumeh-config
```
