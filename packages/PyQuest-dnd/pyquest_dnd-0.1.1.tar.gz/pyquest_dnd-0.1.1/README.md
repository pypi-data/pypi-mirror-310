# PyQuest

PyQuest is a linked list based question and answer platform for your terminal. This acts very similar to quest lines
where each answer correlates to specific paths Ever find yourself in need of a Q&A loop for your program? Here's the
solution! Build out a JSON or YAML file with your questions and answers, choose a display and get back the answers.

## Coming Features
In no particular order here are some addtional features I plan to implement. If you have a feature please request it in the issues section.

- Standard I/O based modules
- New Question and Answer Types:
  - Free Text
  - Select all that apply
  - Optional Questions
- Second Screen for Cruses based modules to print info to
- Encrypted answer templates
- Scored quests
- PyQuest Builder, to aid in mapping your quest
  _I know the current config is messy to make manually, but I plan to make a builder to assist and visualize_
