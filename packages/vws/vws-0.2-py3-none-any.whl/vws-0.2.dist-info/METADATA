## Usage
Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the VirtualWorkspace package:

```python
from vws import Workspace

# Create a new workspace
my_workspace = Workspace("My Workspace")

# Create directories
my_workspace.create_directory("Documents")
my_workspace.create_directory("Images")

# Create files
my_workspace.create_file("resume.pdf", "This is my resume content.")
my_workspace.create_file("photo.jpg", "This is a photo content.")

# List contents of the root directory
print(my_workspace.list_contents())

# List contents of a specific directory
