Welcome to **TorchPhysics**, a Python library of deep learning methods 
for solving differential equations. Currently, TorchPhysics implements
methods like PINN [1]_ and DeepRitz [2]_ which enable the user to

- solve ordinary and partial differential equations 
- train a neural network to approximate solutions for different parameters
- solve inverse problems and interpolate external data via the above methods

TorchPhysics can also be used in other deep learning approaches for differential
equations since it is built in a modular way. For example, TorchPhysics offers
a way to sample points in arbitrary, easy-to-define, domains flexibly.


Guide
=====
All kind of information (features, installation, etc.) to TorchPhysics can be
found under the **Overview** tab. 

As an introduction to TorchPhysics a **Tutorial** exists. There we will present and 
explain the most important aspects and structure of this library. Under the
**Examples** tab additional applications, in form of Jupyter Notebooks,
can be found.
