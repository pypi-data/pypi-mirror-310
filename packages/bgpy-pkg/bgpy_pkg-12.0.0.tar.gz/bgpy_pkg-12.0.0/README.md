abstract = {The security of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and inter-domain routing in general, remains a challenge, in spite of its well-known importance, repeated attacks and incidents, and extensive efforts and research over decades. We present BGPy, an open-source, extensible, robust, easy-to-use and efficient BGP security simulator, to be used for research and education. BGPy allows realistic simulations of a large variety of BGP attacks and defenses. It is provided as a Python package, and can be further customized and extended, e.g., to investigate new attacks and new defense mechanisms. We describe how BGPy is currently used by multiple BGP security projects.},
