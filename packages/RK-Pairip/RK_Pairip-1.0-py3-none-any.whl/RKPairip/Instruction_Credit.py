Install first python ( pkg install python )\n\n2. Script Automatic Install Requirement Module & File\n\n3. Decompile Directory Set Always $HOME ( For Made Script Fast )\n\n4. Script can run to any path, not required apk and script same path\n\n                  {C.c}💢 After Patched 💢\n\n{C.g}1. AppName_Pairip.apk Save Input Path ( Same Dir. )\n\n2. First  Try  “_Pairip.apk” , if it's not working then try replacing “AndroidManifest.xml” and all “.dex” From “_Pairip apk” to “Original_.apk” ( Keep Apk Without Sign )\n\n3. Non Root User Use 'Multi Apk / Dual Space / VPhoneGaGa' For Without Sign Apk Installation & Save “ .mtd String logs save in MT2/dictionary” . ( Not Required Clone/Virtual For Root User & Because able to install apk without Sign )\n\n4. Translate String With MT in Apk Last .dex \n\n5. After Translate String, Fix Pairip Dex with Script  \n\n6. Now Replace '.dex' to apk from “AppName_patched” Folder \n\n7. Now Remove libpairipcore.so & Now the pairip protection has been completely remove\n\n{C.lb}[  {C.rd}NOTE  {C.lb}] {C.y} The purpose of this script is to only restore the string and completely remove the pairip protection, apart from pairip protection your app can have other protections too like Flutter, Jni etc, so your app crashing does not mean that the script is not working, you will have to see apk crash logs.\n\n{C.r}_____________________________________________________________\n{C.r}\n")
