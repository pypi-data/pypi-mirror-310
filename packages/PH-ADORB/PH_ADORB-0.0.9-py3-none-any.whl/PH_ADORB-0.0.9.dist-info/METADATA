# PH-ADORB (WIP):
#### *NOTE: This package is for research and testing purposes only.*
### A Python Package for calculating building 'ADORB' costs:


> A.D.O.R.B. cost: Annualized De-carbonization Of Retrofitted Buildings cost - a “full-cost-accounted” 
annualized life-cycle cost metric for building projects. It includes the (annualized) direct costs of 
retrofit and maintenance, direct energy costs, a carbon cost for both operating and embodied/upfront 
greenhouse gas emissions, and a renewable-energy system-transition cost based on the required 
electrical service capacity.
[[Phius Revive 2024 Retrofit Standard for Buildings v24.1.00]](https://www.phius.org/phius-revive-2024-standard-document)

- - - 
The **ADORB** cost is used as part of the  [Phius-REVIVE](https://www.phius.org/phius-revive-2024) building retrofit program. The [Phius Research Committee](https://github.com/Phius-ResearchComittee) has an example implementation of the **ADORB** calculation which can be found on the [Phius GitHub repository](https://github.com/Phius-ResearchComittee/REVIVE/tree/main/REVIVE2024).


This new PH-ADORB library is an adaptation of Phius's original code into an object-oriented version. This library is a work-in-progress and should NOT be used for any actual Phius compliance analysis or reporting. 

#### *Note: PH-Tools and this PH-ADORB library is in no way affiliated with Phius, and the library here is neither reviewed, nor approved by Phius for use in complying with the REVIVE program.*
