Extending [igraph](https://igraph.org/) to support defining custom classes for links and nodes in a graph.

_Because your graphs aren't just for you_  
*(igraph â†’ ugraph)*


Enhance the **understandability** and **maintainability** of your graphs by defining custom classes for nodes and links. `ugraph` is a wrapper around `igraph`.

#### Installation

Install `ugraph` via pip:

```bash
pip install ugraph
```

#### Usage
Generally, `ugraph` can be used as a replacement for `igraph`. The main difference is that `ugraph` allows you to define custom classes for nodes and links in a graph.
This is useful when you want to store additional information about nodes and links in a graph. Since you are using custom classes (dataclasses) you can benefit from type hints and IDE autocompletion, as well as type checking.

There are some examples on how to use `ugraph` in the [usage](https://github.com/WonJayne/ugraph/tree/main/src/usage) directory.

#### Credits

This project builds upon the excellent [igraph](https://igraph.org/) library. We acknowledge and thank the igraph community for their foundational work.
