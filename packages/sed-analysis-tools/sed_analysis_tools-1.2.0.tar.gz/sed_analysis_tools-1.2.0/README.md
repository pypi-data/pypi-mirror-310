# sed_analysis_tools
A python module to model, fit and analyse single and binary spectral energy distributions (SEDs). This theory behind the code, and the method it implements, are described in Jadhav (2024, in prep).

### Documentation at [jikrant3.github.io/sed-analysis-tools](https://jikrant3.github.io/sed-analysis-tools)



## Installation
```
pip install sed_analysis_tools
```
Requirements: 
`python`>=3.10, `astropy`>=6.0, `matplotlib`>=3.7, `numpy`>=1.24, `pandas`>=2.0, `scipy`>=1.12, `tqdm`>=1.12

The module will download models (e.g. isochrones) and filter transmission curves as required into a `$HOME/.sed_analysis_tools` (or equivalent) folder.

### Getting started
[getting_started](https://jikrant3.github.io/sed-analysis-tools/getting_started.html) and `examples/` contains some guides and jupyter notebooks. 
The `examples/` also contains the code required to recreate the data and plots given in the publication.

Understanding the recoverability of binary system using SED for a given filter set and noise levels.
