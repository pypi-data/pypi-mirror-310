# ACON - Adaptive Correlation Optimization Networks

ACON is an advanced framework designed to optimize machine learning models by leveraging adaptive correlation techniques. It includes modules for real-time data integration, optimization algorithms, meta-learning, and adaptive loss functions. The goal of ACON is to provide tools that enable dynamic model optimization based on evolving data and performance metrics.

### Features

•	Real-time Data Integration: Efficiently integrates incoming data while maintaining a manageable buffer size.

•	Adaptive Optimization: Implements both traditional and advanced optimization techniques (e.g., SGD, Adam) with adaptive learning rates.

•	Meta-Learning: Applies meta-learning strategies to optimize model parameters based on previous task performance.

•	Adaptive Loss Function: Dynamically switches between loss functions (MSE, MAE, Huber) based on training progress.

### Installation

```bash
pip install acon
```
