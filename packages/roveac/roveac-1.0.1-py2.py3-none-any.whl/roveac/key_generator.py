Key Generators
====================

This module provides the `KeyGenerator` class, which defines a method for generating a key 
from a graph for use in dictionary generation and hashing.

Classes
-------
KeyGenerator
    Class for generating keys from graphs.

    Class for generating a unique key from a graph, intended for use
    in dictionary generation and hashing.

    Methods
    -------
    generate_key(G: nx.Graph, method: str)
        Produces a key based on the given graph.

        Generate a unique key for the provided graph `G`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : nx.Graph
            The graph from which to generate the key.
        method : str

        """
        Generate a unique key for the graph `G` based on the count of triangles at each node.

        This method computes the triangle counts for all nodes in `G` and returns a sorted
        tuple of these counts in descending order. The resulting key can be used to identify
        or compare graphs with similar triangle structures.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : nx.Graph
            The graph for which the key is generated, based on triangle counts.

        -------
        tuple of int
            A sorted tuple of triangle counts in descending order, representing the triangle
            structure of `G`.
