Small framework to create bots around the python-telegram-bot library.

A project designed to learn how to manage and create Python packages, driven by the desire to experience building a framework from the ground up.

Expected features:
- Commands to quickly initiate projects and easly expand their structure
- Effortlessly run your bot using a comprehensive settings file that includes all necessary configurations
- Programming based on a handler-callback structure
- HTML template engine for crafting sophisticated bot responses
- Built-in i18n translation system
- Simple database configuration with built-in support for models and migrations
