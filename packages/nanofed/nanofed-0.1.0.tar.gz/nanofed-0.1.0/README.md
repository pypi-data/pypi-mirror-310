## 🌍 What is Federated Learning?

FL is a distributed machine learning approach where multiple clients (devices, organizations) collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data. Instead of sending raw data, clients send model updates to a central server for aggregation. FL enables:
- **Privacy Preservation**: Data remains on the client device.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Decentralized training reduces data transfer overload.
- **Scalable AI**: Collaborative training across distributed environments.
