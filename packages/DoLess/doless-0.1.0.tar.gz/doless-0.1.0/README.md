This class provides methods to perform file operations such as creating, reading, writing, and deleting files.

e.g
```python
from DoLess import fileop
op = fileop("example.txt") #file name
op.mkfile("example.txt") #for making file and writing file this methods take one argument which is file content or text
op.readfile()
op.writefile("Hello World!")
op.delfile()
```
### cls-> dirop('dirname')
**Methods**
-`makdir()`: Creates a new directory with the given name.
-`deldir()`: Deletes the directory with the given name.

This class provides methods to perform directory operations such as creating and deleting directories.

e.g
```python
from DoLess import dirop
op = dirop("exampledir")
op.makdir() #make directory
op.deldir() #delete directory
```
### cls-> currencyconv('amount')
**Methods**
- `UsdToInr()`: Converts the given amount in USD to INR.
- `InrToUsd()`: Converts the given amount in INR to USD.
- `UsdToEuro()`: Converts the given amount in USD to EUR.
- `EuroToUsd()`: Converts the given amount in EUR to USD.
- `InrToEuro()`: Converts the given amount in INR to EUR.
- `EuroToInr()`: Converts the given amount in EUR to INR.
- `UsdToPound()`: Converts the given amount in USD to Pound.
- `PoundToUsd()`: Converts the given amount in Pound to USD.
- `UsdToYen()`: Converts the given amount in USD to Yen.
- `YenToUsd()`: Converts the given amount in Yen to USD.
- `InrToPound()`: Converts the given amount in INR to Pound.
- `PoundToInr()`: Converts the given amount in Pound to INR.
- `InrToYen()`: Converts the given amount in INR to Yen.
- `YenToInr()`: Converts the given amount in Yen to INR.

- 
This class provides methods to perform currency amount calculations based on different currency.

e.g
```python
from DoLess import currencyconv
conv = currencyconv(1000)
print(conv.UsdToInr(1000))
print(conv.InrToUsd(1000))
print(conv.UsdToEuro(1000))
```
