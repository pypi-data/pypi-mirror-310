# Rupi - The FLAMES Game in Python

**Pali** is a simple Python library to play the classic FLAMES game, where you calculate the relationship between two names based on the number of remaining letters after eliminating common ones. The result provides a relationship status like *Friends*, *Love*, *Marriage*, *Enemies*, etc.

## Features

- **FLAMES Calculation**: Determines the relationship between two names.
- **Interactive CLI**: Optionally play the game directly via command line.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate into your Python projects.

## Installation

You can install the `rupi` library via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/rupi/).

### Via pip (from PyPI)
```bash
pip install rupi
```

### From source
To install `rupi` directly from the GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TanujairamV/rupi.git
cd rupi
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

After installing, you can use the `flames` function to determine the relationship between two names.

### Example 1: Using the library in Python

```python
from rupi import flames

# Example names
result = flames("Alice", "Bob")
print(result)  # Output: 'Enemies'
```

### Example 2: Interactive CLI

You can also run the `rupi` package directly from the command line for an interactive FLAMES game.

```bash
python -m rupi.flames
```

This will prompt you to enter two names and will print the relationship result.

### Example Output:

```
Welcome to the FLAMES Game!
Enter the first name: Alice
Enter the second name: Bob
The relationship between Alice and Bob is: Enemies
```
