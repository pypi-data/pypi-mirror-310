Instructions for 
Only edit the files using the following SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE

<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
2. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
3. The dividing line: =======
4. The lines to replace into the source code
5. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
