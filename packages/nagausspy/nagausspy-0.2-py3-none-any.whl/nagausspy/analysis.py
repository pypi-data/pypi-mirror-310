    Filters the input geometries to group the identical ones.

    Note
    ----
    All the geometries must correspond to the same system and with the
    atoms in the same order

    Parameters
    ----------
    geometries : dict(label: nagausspy.GaussianGeometry)
        Dictionary with the geometries to clasify and a label to
        identify them. They key of the dictionary is the label and the
        values are the geometries.

    align_index : list(int)
        List with 3 indexes of the atoms that will be used to align
        the different geometries. The atoms should be chosen such that
        they are in the same relative position in the different
        geometries. Moreover they can't be 3 atoms in the same line.

    reference_indexes : list(int)
        List with the indexes of the atoms than will be used to
        identify the structures

    tolerance : float
        Max displacement of each one of the reference atoms in angstroms.

    Returns
    -------
    result : dict(structure: list(label)) - optional
        Dictionary with the diferent structures and which labels faell
        in that category. Default 1.
