    Creates a functor that behaves as a wideding function. This
    function is defined by a center, an intensity and a widening.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function
        Function to be used as a template for the widening. This
        function must take as arguments the x coordiante, the center, the
        intensity and the wide (in this particular order) and retun the
        value of the y coordinate in such point.
    center : float
        The coordiante of the center of the function
    intensity : float
        The value of the intensity of the function
    widening : float
        The wide of the function
