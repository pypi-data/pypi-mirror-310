# DocFusion

![DodFusion Banner](./assets/docfusion_banner.png)

**DocFusion** is a Python library for deep document visual understanding. It provides a unified interface for a suite of tasks like layout detection, OCR, table extraction, reading order detection, and more. By abstracting the complexities of setting up pipelines across different libraries and models, **DocFusion** makes it easier than ever to integrate and optimize document analysis workflows.

## üöÄ Why DocFusion?

Working with multiple document analysis tools can be challenging due to differences in APIs, outputs, and data formats. **DocFusion** addresses these pain points by:

- **Unifying APIs:** A consistent interface for all tasks, irrespective of the underlying library or model.
- **Pipeline Optimization:** Pre-built, customizable pipelines for end-to-end document processing.
- **Interoperability:** Smooth integration of outputs from different models into cohesive workflows.
- **Ease of Use:** Focus on high-level functionality without worrying about the underlying complexities.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Layout Detection:** Identify the structure of documents with popular models and tools.
- **OCR:** Extract text from images or scanned PDFs with support for multiple OCR engines.
- **Table Extraction:** Parse and extract data from tables in documents.
- **Reading Order Detection:** Determine the logical reading sequence of elements.
- **Custom Pipelines:** Easily configure and extend pipelines to meet specific use cases.
- **Scalability:** Built to handle large-scale document processing tasks.

## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` package manager

To install DocFusion, run:

```bash
pip install docfusion
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Here's a quick example to demonstrate the power of **DocFusion**:

```python
from docfusion import DocFusion

# Initialize DocFusion
docfusion = DocFusion()

# Load a document
doc = docfusion.load_document("sample.pdf")
# Load a images
# doc = docfusion.load_image("sample.png")

# Detect layout
layout = docfusion.detect_layout(doc)

# Perform OCR
text = docfusion.extract_text(doc)

# Extract tables
tables = docfusion.extract_tables(doc)

# Print results
print("Layout:", layout)
print("Text:", text)
print("Tables:", tables)

```

## üìö Supported Models and Libraries

DocFusion integrates seamlessly with a variety of popular tools, including:

(will be updated soon)

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

**DocFusion** organizes document processing tasks into modular components. Each component corresponds to a specific task and offers:

1. **A Unified Interface:** Consistent input and output formats.
2. **Model Independence:** Switch between libraries or models effortlessly.
3. **Pipeline Flexibility:** Combine components to create custom workflows.

## üìà Roadmap

- Add support for semantic understanding tasks (e.g., entity extraction).
- Integrate pre-trained transformer models for context-aware document analysis.
- Expand pipelines for multilingual document processing.
- Add CLI support for batch processing.
