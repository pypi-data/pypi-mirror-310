> [!NOTE]
> This project feature set were driven by personal needs and not a sense to create a general-purpose tool. As such, the tool may not be suitable for all use cases. Please use it with caution and always back up your data before making any changes. It is not intended to replace the official Invoke AI web UI but provides additional functionality for managing orphaned models.

**InvokeAI Models CLI** is a simplified command-line tool for managing orphaned Invoke AI models left in the database after their external sources have been deleted. This tool allows you to list, compare, and delete models automatically or via an interactive selection menu.
