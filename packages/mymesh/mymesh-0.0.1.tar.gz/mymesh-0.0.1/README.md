MyMesh is a general purpose toolbox for generating, manipulating, and analyzing 
meshes for finite element, finite difference, or finite volume simulations. It 
has particular focuses on implicit function and image-based mesh generation.

MyMesh was originally developed in support of the Ph.D. research of Tim 
Josephson in Elise Morganâ€™s Skeletal Mechanobiology and Biomechanics Lab at 
Boston University.
