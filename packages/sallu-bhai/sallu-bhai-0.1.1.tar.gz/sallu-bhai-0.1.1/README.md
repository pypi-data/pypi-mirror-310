Natural Language to Terminal Command AI Library
Overview

This AI library empowers you to interact with your terminal using natural language. By leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), it seamlessly translates your human-readable commands into precise terminal commands.

Installation

Bash
pip install nl2terminal
Use code with caution.

Usage

Python
from nl2terminal import NL2Terminal

# Initialize the NL2Terminal object
nl2t = NL2Terminal()

# Convert a natural language command
terminal_command = nl2t.convert("list all files in the current directory")

# Execute the command
print(terminal_command)  # Output: ls -la
Use code with caution.

Key Features

Natural Language Understanding: Accurately interprets a wide range of natural language commands.
Command Generation: Translates commands into accurate terminal syntax.
Contextual Awareness: Leverages context to provide more precise commands.
Error Handling: Identifies and handles potential errors in command execution.
Customization: Allows for customization of the LLM model and command execution.
Example Use Cases

Automation: Automate repetitive tasks by creating scripts from natural language descriptions.
Scripting: Rapidly prototype scripts without needing to learn complex syntax.
Education: Teach users about terminal commands through natural language interactions.
Accessibility: Make terminal usage more accessible to users with varying technical expertise.
