"""Using these tests:

All of the tetst concerning pydiabas, ediabas and the test_base test in test_ecu can be run
without being connected to a car or even having an USB CAN cable connected.
Only these tests will be executed when running the test module.
There are furhter test concerning specific ECUs. These test need a active connection to a ECU of this kind.
To run test for the MSD80 class, you need to be connected to a car using an MSD80 ECU.
These test need to be run manually!

Make sure to use a 32bit python version when running these test!

COMMANDS
To run all the test which do NOT need a connection to a car please use:
    > python -m unittest test

To run a specific test for an ECU (in this case the MSD80) use:
    > python -m unittest test.test_ecu.test_msd80
