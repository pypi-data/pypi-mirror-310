This is a simple library to interact with the (private) Headspace API.

It is meant for _reading_ data; **writing** data or **accessing the audio** content is not supported and likely never will be.

## Dev

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is used as a replacement for `poetry`.
[Install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) `uv`` first and then it's quick/easy to get going:

```shell
# Note: Yes, this really does need 3.13!
❯ uv venv --python=3.13
Using CPython 3.13.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
# Install dependencies; consider --group=dev
❯ uv sync

```

### .pre-commit

`uv` will have taken care of installing [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) if you used `uv sync --group=dev` to install dev dependencies.

As long as `pre-commit` is in your `$PATH`, connecting it to `git` is simple:

```shell
❯ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

You can run `pre-commit run --all-files` to lint and format your code.

> [!NOTE] The first time you run `pre-commit`, it will take a while to download and install the hooks.

```shell
❯ pre-commit run --all-files

## TODO

- [ ] Tests!
  - [ ] Coming along nicely!
- [ ] pre-commit hooks / general linting
  - [ ] uv / ruff
- [ ] GHA automation for cutting releases and publishing to PyPI.
