# Changelog: `latexminted` â€” Python library for LaTeX minted package



## v0.3.2 (2024-11-24)

*  `pyproject.toml`:  explicitly set `build-backend` (#424).



## v0.3.1 (2024-11-12)

*  Fixed a bug in config detection that caused an error when a data file from
   LaTeX cannot be located.



## v0.3.0 (2024-10-29)

*  Added support for new keywords options (#416):  `extrakeywords`,
   `extrakeywordsconstant`, `extrakeywordsdeclaration`,
   `extrakeywordsnamespace`, `extrakeywordspseudo`, `extrakeywordsreserved`,
   `extrakeywordstype`.

*  Refactored version handling in `cmdline.py` to avoid unnecessary imports.

*  Improved `.errlog.minted` files.  Improved layout and added traceback
   information for the origin in the LaTeX document.  Fixed a bug that could
   cause `.errlog.minted` files to be deleted when they should be kept.
   `.errlog.minted` files now contain all error data from a compile,
   regardless of `highlightmode` setting.  Previously, only the data from the
   last error was kept under some circumstances when `highlightmode` was not
   `immediate`.



## v0.2.0 (2024-10-03)

*  All config data passed back to LaTeX is now processed with `\detokenize`
   (#405).

*  In a cache, `*.index.minted` files are now overwritten only when the data
   they contain is modified.  This fixes compatibility with build tools
   (T-F-S/tcolorbox/issues/294).

*  Fixed a bug that could prevent a cache from being fully cleaned when it is
   shared by multiple documents.

*  All file reading and writing for files received from/sent to LaTeX is now
   UTF-8 (#411).

*  The cache path is now processed correctly when it is an empty string,
   instead of resulting in an error, so the `minted` package will now function
   when `cache=false`.

*  Refactored the `cleanfile` subcommand into `cleanconfig`.  This is more
   descriptive for actual usage and allows all subcommands to take the same
   arguments.

*  Added subcommand `cleantemp`, which only cleans temp files, not cache
   files.

*  All subcommands now take exactly the same arguments.

*  Added short summary and links to `latexminted --version` (#404).



## v0.1.0 (2024-09-22)

*  Initial release.
