# Handles converting millivolt readings into degrees Celcius for an Analog Devices

"""
The equation governing this is specified as:
V_OUT = (T_MJ * 5 mV/Â°C) + V_REF
where
- T_MJ is the thermocouple measurement junction temperature.
- V_OUT is the measured output voltage
- V_REF is the reference voltage, which has been configured to 0 on the hardware.
Substituting V_REF=0 and rearranging this equation gives:

T_MJ = V_OUT / 5 mV

i.e. every 5 mV gives 1 degree celcius increase
