    Displays raw HTML.

    The `Html` component allows you to embed arbitrary HTML in your app. It
    takes HTML code as input and renders it.

    To embed an entire website, use the `Website` component instead.

    Note that pointer events are disabled per default. If your HTML content
    needs to be interactive, assign `pointer-events: auto;` to your root
    element.


    ## Attributes

    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Welcome to rio!</p>
    ''')
    """

    html: str
