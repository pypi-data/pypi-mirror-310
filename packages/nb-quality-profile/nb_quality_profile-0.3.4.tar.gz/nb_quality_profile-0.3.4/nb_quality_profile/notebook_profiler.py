# # Notebook Profiles
#
# This exploratory coding notebook explores several techniques to support the static profiling of Jupyter notebooks as texts, reporting on various metrics, including:
#
# - notebook size (markdown and code line counts);
# - readability scores;
# - reading time estimates;
# - code complexity and maintability.
#
# The motivating context was a tool for generating summary reports on the estimated workload associated with 100 or so  notebooks over 25 or so directories (1 directory / 4 notebooks per week) for a third year undergraduate equivalent Open University course on data management and analysis.
#
# Previous notebook recipes include generating simple reports that pull out headings from notebooks to act as notebook summaries (eg [`Get Contents`](https://github.com/innovationOUtside/TM351_forum_examples/blob/master/Get%20Contents.ipynb)). Such recipes may provide a useful component in a notebook quality report if the report is also intended to provide a summary / overview of notebooks. (It might be most useful to offer heading summaries as an option in a notebook profiling report?)
#
# Tools supporting the profiling of one or more notebooks across one or more directories and the generation of simple statistics over them are also provided.
#
# The profiler is also capabale of running simple health checks over a notebook, for example reporting on:
#
# - whether code cells have been executed, and if so, whether code cell execution in complete and in linear order;
# - packages / modules loaded in to the notebook;
# - unused code items in a notebook (for example, modules loaded but not used).
#
# Currently, code profiling is only applied to code that appears in code cells, not code that is quoted or described in markdown cells.
#
# There is a potential for making IPython magics for some of the reporting functions (for example, `radon` or `wily` reports) to provide live feedback / reporting during the creation of content in a notebook.
#
# *Code has been extract from this notebook into the `nb_quality_profile` package. If experiments are made updating code in this notebook, it will need mirroring in the actual package...*
#
# ### Notebooks
#
# In the first instance, reports are generated for code cell inputs and markdown cells; code outputs and raw cells are not considered. Code appearing in markdown cells is identified as code-like but not analysed in terms of code complexity etc.
#
# For each markdown cell, we can generate a wide range of simple text document statistics. Several packages exist to support such analyses (for example, [`textstat`](https://github.com/shivam5992/textstat), [`readability`](https://github.com/andreasvc/readability/)) but the focus in this notebook will be on metrics derived using the [`spacy`](https://spacy.io/) underpinned by the local `text_stats.py` package for things like readability metrics. Several simple custom metrics are also suggested.
#
# For code in code cells, the [`radon`](https://radon.readthedocs.io) package is used to generate code metrics, with additional packages providing further simple metrics.
#
# A test notebook is provided (`Notebook_profile_test.ipynb`) against which we can test various elements of this notebook.
#
# ### Potential Future Work
#
# In terms of analysing cell outputs (not covered as yet), reports could be generated on the sorts of asset that appear to be displayed in each cell output, whether code warnings or errors are raised, etc. There is also potential for running in association with something like [`nbval`](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval) to test that notebooks test correctly against previously run cell outputs.
#
# We might also explore the extent to which interactive notebook profiling tools, such as magics or notebook extensions, be used to support the authoring of new instructional notebooks.
#
# We might also ask to what extent might interactive notebook profiling tools be used to support learners working through instructional material and reflecting on their work? Code health metrics, such as [cell execution success](https://nbgallery.github.io/health_paper.html) used by *nbgallery* may provide clues regarding which code activity cells students struggled to get working, for example. By looking at statistics across students (for example, in assessment notebooks with cell execution success log monitoring enabled) we may be able to identify "healthy" or "unhealthy" activities; for example, a healthy activity is one in which students can get their code to run with one or two tries, an unhealthy activity is one where they make repeated attempts at trying to get the code to work as they desire.
#
# The notebook profiler should also be runnable against notebooks created using Jupytext from markdown rendered from OU-XML. It would probably make *more* sense to build a custom OU-XML profiler, eg one that could perhaps draw on a summary XML doc generated from OU-XML source docs using XSLT. I'll try to bear in mind creating reporting functions that might be useable in this wider sense. (OU-XML will also have thngs like a/v components, and may have explicit time guidance on expected time spent on particular activities.)

# ## Settings
#
# The following parameters are used notebook wide in the generation of reports.

# +
READING_RATE = 100 # words per minute
# What is a sensible reading rate for undergraduate level academic teaching material?
# 250 wpm gives a rate of 15,000 wph
# 10,000 wph corresponds to about 170 words per minute
# OU guidance: 35 wpm for challenging texts, 70 wpm for medium texts, 120 wpm for easy texts

CODE_READING_RATE = 35 # tokens per minute -- UNUSED

CODE_LINE_READING_TIME = 1 # time in seconds to read a code line

LINE_WIDTH = 160 #character width of a line of markdown text; used to calculate "screen lines"

CODE_CELL_REVIEW_TIME = 5 # nominal time in seconds to run each code cell / review each code cell output

CELL_SKIP_TIME = 1 # nominal time in seconds to move from one cell to the next

# ## Analyse Markdown Cells
#
# Iterate through markdown cells and generate cell by cell reports.

# Estimates of reading time are often based on word count estimates. The Medium website use a reading time estimator that also factors in the presence of images in a text as well as wordcount / sentence length. The [`readtime`](https://github.com/alanhamlett/readtime) package uses the Medium reading time estimation algorithm to give a reading time estimate.
#
#
# ?? TO DO - more on the reading time equation; also need something like maybe: +10s for every code cell to run it and look at output? Different reading time per line of code?
#
# *It might be worth looking at forking this reading time estimator and try to factor in reading time elements that reflect the presence of code? Or maybe use a slower reading rate for code? Or factor in code complexity? The presence of links might also affect reading time.*

# #### Code Blocks in Markdown Cells
# A question arises when we have code blocks appearing in markdown cells. How should these be treated? Should we report the code toward markdown counts, or should we separately treat the code, discounting it from markdown word counts but reporting it as "code in markdown"?
#
# Another approach might be to include and codes of block appearing in markdown cells as part of the markdown word count, but provide an additional report identifying how many lines of code appeared as part of the markdown.

# The `excode` package (renamed [`exdown`](https://github.com/nschloe/exdown), now deprecated in favour of [`pytest-codeblocks`](https://github.com/nschloe/pytest-codeblocks/)) provides an easy way of grabbing code blocks from markdown text, so we might be able to use that to mprove the handling of code blocks inside markdown cells.
#
# Could we also just use the detected code in a replace to strip out the code? eg when checking headers?
# Lets grab a simple text case of some markdown containing some code blocks:

# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# mc = nb.cells[2]['source']
# print(mc)
# -

# Let's see if we can extract those code blocks...

# +
# Deprecated in favour of pytest-codeblocks
# import excode

import io
from pytest_codeblocks import extract_from_buffer


# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# #excode seems to expect a file buffer...
# extract_from_buffer(io.StringIO(mc))
# -

# We can now report on the structure of code blocks in markdown cells more directly:

def code_block_report(c):
    """Generate simple code report when passed a list of code lines
        or a string containing multiple `\n` separated code lines."""
    
    # Grab code from extracted CodeBlock object
    c = c if isinstance(c, str) else c.code
    
    n_total_code_lines = 0
    n_code_lines = 0
    n_blank_code_lines = 0
    n_single_line_comment_code_lines = 0
    
    #We won't count leading or lagging empty lines as code lines...
    lines = c.strip().splitlines() if isinstance(c, str) else c
        
    #print(lines)
    
    n_total_code_lines = len(lines)
    
    n_blank_code_lines, n_single_line_comment_code_lines, \
        n_code_lines = _code_block_summarise(lines,
                                             n_blank_code_lines,
                                             n_single_line_comment_code_lines,
                                             n_code_lines)
    
    return (n_total_code_lines, n_blank_code_lines,\
            n_single_line_comment_code_lines, n_code_lines)


# Running the above function should generate some simple code statistics:

# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# print(mc)
# for c in extract_from_buffer(io.StringIO(mc)):
#     (n_total_code_lines, n_blank_code_lines, \
#          n_single_line_comment_code_lines, n_code_lines) = code_block_report(c)
#
#     print(n_total_code_lines, n_blank_code_lines, \
#           n_single_line_comment_code_lines, n_code_lines )
# -

# We could also use the `radon` code analyser (which does count empty lines as code lines unless we explictly strip them).
#
# However, it should be noted that the `radon` code analysis relies on well formed Python code that can be loaded as into the Python AST parser. This means that code that doesn't parse as valid Python, either because it contains an error or because the code is not actually Python code (for example, in course materials we make use of SQL block magic to allow us to write SQL code in a code cell).
#
# The `radon` parser will also report an error if it comes across IPython line or cell magic code, or `!` prefixed shell commands.
#
# We will see later how we can start to cleanse a code string of IPython `!` and `%` prefixed directives when we consider parsing code cells.

# ### Code Reading (and Execution) Time
#
# It would be useful if we had a heuristic for code reading time.
#
# One approach would be to tokenise the code and estimate reading time from a simple "tokens per minute" reading rate, or use a reading rate appropriate for "difficult" text. Another approach might be to try to make use of code complexity scores and code length.
#
# A pragmatic way may just be to estimate based on lines of code, with a nominal reading time allocated to each line of code.

    """Crude reading time estimate for a code block."""
    code_reading_time = line_time * (n_code_lines + n_single_line_comment_code_lines)
    return code_reading_time


# The way we currently process code in markdown cells, it will be timed at the standard reading rate. It may be appropriate to add a simple modifier that also adds a "code reading overhead" to the reading time based on the amount of code in a markdown cell.
#
# For code in code cells, rather than code blocks in markdown cells, might also be worth exploring *code execution time*, that is, an overhead associated with running each code cell. A crude way of calculating this would be to levy a fixed amount of time to account for running the code cell and inspecting the result. A more considered approach would look to cell profiling / execution time logs and code cell outputs in a run notebook.

# ### Custom Report Aggregator

# For convenience, we can bundle up the custom metrics we have created into a function that returns a single report object.

The lower bound giving by the summed reading time in *seconds* more closely relates to the markdown word count.
#

Whilst this may be invisible to the reader if a markdown cell follows a markdown cell, it may be more evident when going from a markdown cell to a code cell.

# > In directory X there were N notebooks. The total markdown wordcount for notebooks in the directory was NN. The total number of lines of code across the notebooks was NN. The total estimated reading time across the notebooks was NN.
# >
# > At the notebook level:
# > - notebook A: markdown wordcount NN, lines of code NN, estimated reading time NN;
#
# It might also be useful to provide simple rule (cf. linter rules) that raise warnings about notebooks that go against best practice. For example, notebooks with word counts / code line counts or reading or completion times that exceed recommended limits.

# ## Code Cell Analysis
#
# As well as reporting on markdown cells, we can also generate reports on code cells. (We could also use similar techiques to report on code blocks found in markdown cells.)
#
# Possible code cell reports include reporting on:
#
# - packages imported into a notebook;
# - number of lines of code  / code comments;
# - code complexity.
#
# We could also run static analysis tests over *all* the code loaded into a notebook, for example using things like [`importchecker`](https://github.com/zopefoundation/importchecker) to check that imports are actually used.
#
# Checks against whether code cells in a notebooks: a) have been run; b) whether they have been run in order are also possible. If we extend the analysis to code cell outputs, we could also report on whether cells had been run without warning or error and what sort of output they produced.
#
# Tools such as [`pyflakes`](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes) can also be used to run a wider range of static tests over a codebase, as can other code linters. See also [*Thinking About Things That Might Be Autogradeable or Useful for Automated Marking Support*](https://blog.ouseful.info/2019/12/10/thinking-about-things-that-might-be-autogradeable/) for examples of tests that may be used in autograding, some of which might also be useful for notebook code profiling.
#
# It might also be worth trying to collate possible useful guidelines / heuristics / rules of thumb for creating notebooks that could also provide the basis of quality minded linting checks.
#
# For example:
#
# - a markdown cell should always appear before a code cells to set the context for what the code cell is expected to achieve;
# - a markdown cell commenting on the output of a code cell immediately preceding may be appropriate in some cases;
# - one cell should be defined per code cell. A markdown cell immediately following a code cell that defines a function might include a line of text that might also serve as the function doc text, describing what the function does an dprefacing a code cell that demonstrates the behaviour of the function.

# ## Visualising Notebook Structure
#
# To provide a glanceable, macroscopic way of comparing the size and structure of multiple notebooks, we can generate a simple visualisation based on screen line counts and colour codes for different cell types or cell state.
#
# Reports that include cell index and a simple line count (for example, reprting the number of code lines or screen lines for markdown) can be rendered directly as linear visualisations showing the overall structure of a notebook.
#
# For example:
#
# - markdown: header;
# - markdown: paragraph;
# - markdown: code block;
# - markdown: blank line;
# - code: code;
# - code: comment;
# - code: magic;
# - code: blank line;
# - other: other cells.
#
# To profile within a cell requires access to cell internals, or generating a cell profile during cell processing.
#
# However, it's easy enough to generate a view over the code and markdown cells.
#
# Let's start by exploring a simple representation:

# + editable=true slideshow={"slide_type": ""}
# #%pip install matplotlib==3.7.5
# -

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# %matplotlib inline

# + tags=["active-ipynb"]
# fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# #Simple representation of lines per cell and cell colour based on cell type
# n_c = [(1, 'r'), (2, 'pink'), (1, 'cornflowerblue'), (2, 'pink')]
#
# x = 0
# y = 0
#
# for height, color in n_c:
#     _y = y + height
#     plt.plot([x, x], [y, _y], color=color, linewidth=5)
#     y = _y  # may want to add a gap when moving from one cell to next
#
# plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
# plt.show()
# -

# We can get the list of cell size and colour tuples from a notebook's report data frame:

# + tags=["active-ipynb"]

# ### Visualing Intra-Cell Structure
#
# For example, paragraphs and code blocks in markdown cells; comment lines, empty lines, code lines, magic lines / blocks, shell command lines in code cells.
#
# Supporting the level of detail may be be tricky. A multi-column format is probably best showing eg an approximate "screen's worth" of content in a column then the next "scroll" down displayed in the next column along.

# ## Checking Notebook Metrics Evolution Over Time
#
# The `wily` package uses `radon` to produce code quality reports across a git repository history and generate charts showin the evolution of metrics over the lifetime of a repository. This suggests various corollaries:
#
# - could we generate `wily` style measures over the recent history of a notebook code cell?
# - could we generate `wily` style temporal measures over all the reports (markdown text, as well as code) generated from a notebook across several commits of it to a git repository.

# ## Other Cell Analysis
#
# As a placeholder, should we also at least report on a count of cells that are note code or markdown cells?
#
# Also a count of empty cells?
#
# Is this moving towards some sort of notebook linter?
