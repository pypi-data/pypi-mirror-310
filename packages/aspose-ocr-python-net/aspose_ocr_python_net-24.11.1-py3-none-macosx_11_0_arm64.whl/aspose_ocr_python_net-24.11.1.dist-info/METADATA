**Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET** is a powerful, while easy-to-use optical character recognition (OCR) engine for your Python applications and notebooks. In less than **10** lines of code, you can recognize text in **28** languages based on Latin, Cyrillic, and Asian scripts, returning results in the most popular document and data interchange formats. 
There is no need to learn complex mathematical models, build machine learning algorithms and train neural networks — our simple and robust API will do everything for you.

The library works equally well with all sources, from a high-quality scan to a quick photo on a smartphone. Whether the image is rotated, distorted or noisy — automatic pre- and post-processing filters provide the highest recognition accuracy in the shortest time.

### Code snippet

**Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET** is extremely easy to use, regardless of the application's scale and complexity. Let's try to create a very simple application that can extract text from images and output it to the console.

1. Install  the latest version of the *aspose-ocr* package using pip.
2. Import `aspose.ocr` module into the application.
3. Create an instance of `AsposeOcr` class.
4. Create an instance of `OcrInput` class and add one or more images to it.
5. Extract text from the image using `Recognize` method.
6. Output the extracted text to the console.

Full code:

```python
import aspose.ocr as ocr

# Initialize OCR engine
api = AsposeOcr()

# Initialize OCR input
input = OcrInput(InputType.SINGLE_IMAGE)
input.add("1.png")
input.add("2.jpg")

# Recognize images
result = api.recognize(input)

# Print result
print(result[0].recognition_text)
print(result[1].recognition_text)
```
