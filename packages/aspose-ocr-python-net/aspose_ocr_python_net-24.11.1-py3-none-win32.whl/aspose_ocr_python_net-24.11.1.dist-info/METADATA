**Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET** is a powerful, while easy-to-use optical character recognition (OCR) engine for your Python applications and notebooks. In less than **10** lines of code, you can recognize text in **135** languages based on Latin, Cyrillic, and Asian scripts, returning results in the most popular document and data interchange formats. 
There is no need to learn complex mathematical models, build machine learning algorithms and train neural networks — our simple and robust API will do everything for you.

The library works equally well with all sources, from a high-quality scan to a quick photo on a smartphone. Whether the image is rotated, distorted or noisy — automatic pre- and post-processing filters provide the highest recognition accuracy in the shortest time.

## Recognition languages

Aspose OCR is the perfect solution for global applications and multi-lingual documents. With support for nearly [all languages](https://docs.aspose.com/ocr/python-net/recognition-languages/), it ensures accurate text extraction across a wide range of scripts and alphabets. Our engine excels at handling mixed-language documents, such as those featuring both Chinese and English.

- Extended Latin (English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and other European languages)
- Cyrillic (Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, and more)
- Arabic and Persian
- Chinese
- Hindi and other Devanagari-based scripts
- Korean
- Japanese

Aspose OCR can also extract text from handwritten notes and street photos.

## Key features

- **Universal** – Effortlessly extract text from any image, whether it's a high-quality scan or a casual street photo, captured via scanner or camera.  
- **Fast** – Achieve rapid text recognition, processing a page in just seconds with minimal resource consumption. Adjust recognition speed, quality, and resource usage according to your specific needs.  
- **Developer-friendly** – With just a few lines of code, easily convert images to text, create searchable PDFs, save recognition results to documents, and more, integrating OCR into your workflows seamlessly.  
- **Modular** – Maintain a lean and efficient application by selectively incorporating advanced features from our comprehensive resource repository.  
- **Reliable** – Experience exceptional recognition accuracy, even with challenging images that are blurry, rotated, distorted, or noisy.  
- **Tesseract alternative** – Aspose OCR outperforms Tesseract in complex scenarios, ensuring superior accuracy in cases where Tesseract may struggle or fail.

## Supported file formats

Aspose OCR can handle nearly any file format from scanners or cameras, including:

- JPEG, PNG, BMP, and GIF images
- Single-page and multi-page TIFF files
- PDF documents
- DjVu files

All above-mentioned files can be read directly from web links. You can also use Aspose OCR to perform bulk recognition on images within folders and archives, streamlining large-scale document processing.

The recognition results are returned in popular file and data exchange formats, enabling easy storage, database import, or real-time analysis:

- Plain Text
- Searchable PDF
- Microsoft Word or Excel documents
- HTML
- RTF
- ePUB
- JSON and XML


## Get Started

Run ```pip install aspose-ocr-python-net``` to fetch the package. If you already have **Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET** and want to get the latest version, please run ```pip install --upgrade aspose-ocr-python-net```.

### Code snippet

**Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET** is extremely easy to use, regardless of the application's scale and complexity. Let's try to create a very simple application that can extract text from images and output it to the console.

1. Install  the latest version of the *aspose-ocr* package using pip.
2. Import `aspose.ocr` module into the application.
3. Create an instance of `AsposeOcr` class.
4. Create an instance of `OcrInput` class and add one or more images to it.
5. Extract text from the image using `Recognize` method.
6. Output the extracted text to the console.

Full code:

```python
import aspose.ocr as ocr

# Initialize OCR engine
api = AsposeOcr()

# Initialize OCR input
input = OcrInput(InputType.SINGLE_IMAGE)
input.add("1.png")
input.add("2.jpg")

# Recognize images
result = api.recognize(input)

# Print result
print(result[0].recognition_text)
print(result[1].recognition_text)
```
