# justnotiondb
A minimalistic python package focused solely on extracting databases from Notion

## Installation
```python
pip install justnotiondb
```

## Usage

First of all, you will need to create a Notion API token. Visit [Notion integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) and create a new integration.

</p>

After that, you will need to set up a connection to the database you want to extract. You can do this by going to your database and opening settings (by clicking the three dots in the top right corner) and then clicking "Connect to". Your integration will appear in the list. If your database has relations to other databases, you will need to set up a connection to those databases as well.

</p>

Now you can use `justnotiondb` to extract the database. To do that, first you need to create a `NotionClient` instance and pass the secret you had created.
```python
from justnotiondb.notion import NotionClient, DB

client = NotionClient(secret='secret')

# You can check if the connection is valid
print(client.check()) # True or False

# If token provided is not valid, you may see the error message
print(client.error)
```

Now you can create `DB` class passing the client and database ID. To get database ID visit [Notion Database ID](https://developers.notion.com/reference/retrieve-a-database) to undestand how to do it.

To extract the database use `get` method. It takes a filter and/or a sort and returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a page in the database. The keys of each dictionary are the properties of the page, and the values are the values of the properties. Each property was processed according to its type. You can check how it was processed in the `processors.py` file.

Visit [Notion Database Query Filter](https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-database-query-filter) to understand how to build a filter and [Notion Database Query Sort](https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-database-query-sort) to understand how to build a sort.

```python
filter = {
    'property': 'Date',
    'date': {
        'on_or_after': '2025-01-01'
    }
}
sort = [{
    "property": "Date",
    "direction": "descending"
}]
db = DB(client=client, id='database_id').get(filter=filter, sort=sort)

# It is also possible to extract raw data using `fetch` method
db_raw = DB(client=client, id='database_id').fetch(filter=filter, sort=sort)
```

If you want, you can also write the results to a CSV or JSON file. Others formats are not supported yet.
```python
DB.write_csv(content=db, path='file.csv')

DB.write_json(content=db, path='file.json')
```

## Processors

Each property has a processor associated with it. These processors are responsible for extracting the property's value appropriately. Below is a list of all processors and how they process the value.
