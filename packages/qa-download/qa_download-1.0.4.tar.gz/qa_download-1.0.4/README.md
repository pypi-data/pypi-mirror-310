Here's the updated `README.md` with samples for downloading using a YouTube URL, along with a note recommending using the song name for better metadata matching:

# Music Downloader ðŸŽ¶

**Music Downloader** is a Python tool that downloads music from YouTube and automatically embeds metadata, album artwork, and lyrics from Genius. Perfect for building your offline music library with well-organized tags and rich media.

## Features

- **Downloads audio** from YouTube as MP3
- **Embeds metadata** like title, artist, album, and release date
- **Fetches album artwork** and attaches it to the MP3
- **Adds lyrics** automatically from Genius
- Works with most Python environments and media players

## Installation

You can install Music Downloader via the `qa-download` package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install qa-download
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- YouTube audio extraction and metadata libraries (automatically installed with the package)

## Usage

Once installed, use `music-downloader` directly from the command line.

**Recommended:** Using the song title (instead of a YouTube URL) gives more accurate metadata from Genius.

### Downloading by Song Name

Using a song title helps **Music Downloader** find better metadata, artwork, and lyrics from Genius:

```bash
music-downloader "Song Title"
```

By default, files are saved in your Music directory, but you can specify a custom directory with the `--output_dir` option:

```bash
music-downloader "Song Title" --output_dir "/path/to/save/music"
```

### Downloading by YouTube URL

If you have a specific YouTube URL, you can still use it with the downloader. However, it may miss some metadata, so using the song title is recommended for a richer media experience.

```bash
music-downloader "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXAMPLE_VIDEO_ID"
```

For YouTube playlists, simply provide the playlist URL:

```bash
music-downloader "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=EXAMPLE_PLAYLIST_ID"
```

In both cases, **Music Downloader** will download each video in the playlist and try to match metadata from Genius for each song.

### Example Commands

```bash
# Recommended method for best metadata
music-downloader "Let Me Down Slowly Alec Benjamin"

# Using a single YouTube video URL
music-downloader "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXAMPLE_VIDEO_ID"

# Using a YouTube playlist URL
music-downloader "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=EXAMPLE_PLAYLIST_ID"
```

### Command-Line Options

- `input`: The YouTube URL, playlist URL, or song title you want to download.
- `--output_dir`: Custom directory to save the downloaded audio. Defaults to `~/Music`.
