# COTI Contracts Examples

All repositories specified below contain smart contracts that implement confidentiality features using the COTI V2 protocol.
The contracts provide examples for various use cases, such as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), ERC20 tokens, Auction, and Identity management.

These contracts demonstrate how to leverage the confidentiality features of the COTI V2 protocol to enhance privacy and security in decentralized applications.
The contracts are of Solidity and can be compiled and deployed using popular development tools like Hardhat and Foundry (Work in progress).

# Hardhat ([coti-contracts-examples](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-contracts-examples))

The `coti-contracts-examples` project is composed of two main components:

1. **gcEVM Precompiles** (located in `contracts/precompiles`): These are a set of examples that make use of the gcEVM core libraries. For a full description of these precompiles visit the [precompiles readme](contracts/precompiles/README.md).

2. **Example contracts** (located in `contracts`): the examples folder contain Solidity contracts that perform various use cases, such as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), ERC20 tokens, Auction, and Identity management. It contains smart contracts that implement confidentiality features using the COTI V2 protocol.

The following example contracts are available for Hardhat Runtime Environment for deployment and execution:

| Contract                     | Contract Description                                                                                                                          |

| PrivateAuction               | Confidential auction - encrypted bid amount                                                                                                   |
| PrivateIdentityRegistry      | Confidential Identity Registry - Encrypted identity data                                                                                      |

## Usage

### Private ERC20 Token

The following process will help you run the [**PrivateToken.sol**](/contracts/PrivateToken.sol) example from the [**COTI contracts examples**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-contracts-examples) project. The contract defines a custom ERC20 token called `PrivateToken` that extends the functionality of the PrivateERC20 token. Additionally it will:

* Create a EOA (Externally Owned Account)
* Validate minimum balance

The contract is compiled and deployed with Hardhat using the [`PrivateToken.test.ts`](/test/PrivateToken.test.ts) test suite contained in the [`test`](/test) directory of the project.

> [!NOTE]  
> Ensure your environment meets all the pre-requisites. Visit the [pre-requisites section of the readme](/README.md).

1.  Clone the confidentiality-contracts  repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/coti-io/coti-contracts-examples.git
    ```


2.  Change directory to the newly create one

    ```bash
    cd coti-contracts-examples
    ```


3.  Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```


4.  Build and compile contracts

    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```


5.  Run the `PrivateToken` test suite

    ```bash
    npm run test-private-token
    ```

    Running this test will automatically create an account and a key/value pair with name: `SIGNING_KEYS` (visible in the .env file). The script will output something like this:


    ```bash
    yarn run v1.22.22

      Private Token
        1) "before all" hook in "Private Token"

      0 passing (39ms)
      1 failing

      1) Confidential ERC20
           "before all" hook in "Private Token":
         Error: Created new random account 0x17EDB982c3569D29EbaF407F72aDD05722d5f179.
         Please use faucet to fund it.
    ```

    \
    It is normal to receive the exception `Error: Created new random account [...] Please use faucet to fund it.` on the first run. This will be resolved once the account is funded.  

6. Head to the faucet at [**https://faucet.coti.io**](https://faucet.coti.io) to get testnet funds. \
   Send the following message to the BOT using your newly created account, visible in the last part of the response.\
   \
   `testnet <account address>`\
   \
   The bot will reply with the message:\
   \
   `<username> faucet transferred 10 COTIv2 (testnet)` \
   &#x20;
7.  Run the `PrivateToken` test suite once more.

    ```bash
    npm run test-private-token
    ```

    \
    The script output will look like this:  


    ```bash
    Private Token
    ************* Onboarding user  0x17EDB982c3569D29EbaF407F72aDD05722d5f179  *************

          ✔ Owner initial balance (123ms)
          ✔ Function 'name' should be correct (130ms)
          ✔ Function 'symbol' should be correct (123ms)
          ✔ Function 'decimals' should be correct (119ms)
          ✔ Function 'totalSupply' should be correct (117ms)
        Transfer 5
          ✔ Transfer - clear (9469ms)
          ✔ Transfer - Confidential (5260ms)
          ✔ TransferFrom - clear without giving allowance should fail (9905ms)
          ✔ TransferFrom - clear (9770ms)
          ✔ TransferFrom - Confidential (10265ms)
          ✔ Approve/Allowance - Confidential (10255ms)

      12 passing (1m)

    ✨  Done in 69.69s.
    ```


Running the test suite does the following:

* **Deploys the `PrivateToken` contract**: Sets up the token with specific details (name, symbol, initial supply).
* **Tests the deployment**: Verifies the contract address, initial balance, and token details (name, symbol, decimals, total supply).
* **Tests transfers**: Both clear and confidential transfers, including `transferFrom` functionality with and without prior allowance.
* **Tests approvals and allowances**: Ensures that the contract correctly handles approvals and allowances, both clear and confidential.

8. You may also run specific tests

   ```
   npm run test-private-nft
   ```

   or

   ```
   npm run test-private-token
   ```

   or

   ```
   npm run test-private-auction
   ```

   or
