# odatse-SXRD: solver module for analyses of SXRD data

Open Data Analysis Tool for Science and Engineering (ODAT-SE) is a framework for applying a search algorithm to a direct problem solver to find the optimal solution. It has been developed by the name 2DMAT, and since version 3.0, it is organized as an open platform for data analysis by modularizing direct problem solvers and search algorithms.

`sxrdcalc` has been developed as a software package for the analyses of the surface X-ray diffraction data, which calculates the X-ray diffraction intensity from surface, the Patterson map of experimental data, and the fitting of model structure to the experimental data by Levenberg-Marquadt method or simulated annealing method. odatse-SXRD is an adaptor library to use `sxrdcalc` as a direct problem solver of ODAT-SE.


## Prerequisites

- Required
  - python >= 3.9
  - numpy >= 1.14
  - pydantic >= 2.0
  - ODAT-SE >= 3.0
  - sxrdcalc

## Install

- From PyPI (Recommended)
  - `python3 -m pip install -U odatse-SXRD`
    - If you install them locally, use `--user` option like `python3 -m pip install -U --user`
- From Source (For developers)
  1. update `pip >= 19` by `python3 -m pip install -U pip`
  2. `python3 -m pip install ODATSE_SXRD_ROOT_DIRECTORY` to install `odatse-SXRD` package and `odatse-SXRD` command
    - `ODATSE_SXRD_ROOT_DIRECTORY` points to the directory including this `README.md` file.

## Simple Usage

- `odatse-SXRD input.toml` (use the installed script)
- `python3 src/main.py input.toml` (use the raw script)
- For details of the input file, see the document.
