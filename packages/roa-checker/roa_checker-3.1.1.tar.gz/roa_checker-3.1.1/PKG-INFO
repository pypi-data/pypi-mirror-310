## Usage
* [roa\_checker](#roa_checker)


I can expand these if anyone actually uses this repo (lmk @ jfuruness@gmail.com)

```python
def test_tree():
    # TODO: Break up into unit tests
    trie = ROAChecker()
    cidrs = [ip_network(x) for x in ["1.2.0.0/16", "1.2.3.0/24", "1.2.3.4"]]
    routed_origin = 1
    for cidr in cidrs:
        trie.insert(cidr, ROA(cidr, routed_origin, cidr.prefixlen))
    for cidr in cidrs:
        outcome = trie.get_roa_outcome(cidr, routed_origin)
        assert outcome == ROAOutcome(ROAValidity.VALID, ROARouted.ROUTED)
        assert ROAValidity.is_unknown(outcome.validity) is False
        assert ROAValidity.is_invalid(outcome.validity) is False
        assert ROAValidity.is_valid(outcome.validity) is True

    non_routed_cidrs = [ip_network(x) for x in ["2.2.0.0/16", "2.2.3.0/24", "2.2.3.4"]]
    non_routed_origin = 0
    for cidr in non_routed_cidrs:
        trie.insert(cidr, ROA(cidr, non_routed_origin, cidr.prefixlen))
    for cidr in non_routed_cidrs:
        outcome = trie.get_roa_outcome(cidr, routed_origin)
        assert outcome == ROAOutcome(ROAValidity.INVALID_ORIGIN, ROARouted.NON_ROUTED)

    outcome = trie.get_roa_outcome(ip_network("1.0.0.0/8"), routed_origin)
    assert outcome.validity == ROAValidity.UNKNOWN
    assert outcome.routed_status == ROARouted.UNKNOWN
    outcome = trie.get_roa_outcome(ip_network("255.255.255.255"), routed_origin)
    assert outcome.validity == ROAValidity.UNKNOWN
    assert outcome.routed_status == ROARouted.UNKNOWN
    assert ROAValidity.is_unknown(outcome.validity) is True
    assert ROAValidity.is_invalid(outcome.validity) is False
    assert ROAValidity.is_valid(outcome.validity) is False
    outcome = trie.get_roa_outcome(ip_network("1.2.4.0/24"), routed_origin)
    assert outcome.validity == ROAValidity.INVALID_LENGTH
    assert outcome.routed_status == ROARouted.ROUTED
    assert ROAValidity.is_unknown(outcome.validity) is False
    assert ROAValidity.is_invalid(outcome.validity) is True
    assert ROAValidity.is_valid(outcome.validity) is False
    outcome = trie.get_roa_outcome(ip_network("1.2.3.0/24"), routed_origin + 1)
    assert outcome.validity == ROAValidity.INVALID_ORIGIN
    assert outcome.routed_status == ROARouted.ROUTED
    assert ROAValidity.is_unknown(outcome.validity) is False
    assert ROAValidity.is_invalid(outcome.validity) is True
    assert ROAValidity.is_valid(outcome.validity) is False
    outcome = trie.get_roa_outcome(ip_network("1.2.4.0/24"), routed_origin + 1)
    assert outcome.validity == ROAValidity.INVALID_LENGTH_AND_ORIGIN
    assert outcome.routed_status == ROARouted.ROUTED
    assert ROAValidity.is_unknown(outcome.validity) is False
    assert ROAValidity.is_invalid(outcome.validity) is True
    assert ROAValidity.is_valid(outcome.validity) is False
    outcome = trie.get_roa_outcome(ip_network("1.2.0.255"), routed_origin)
    assert outcome.validity == ROAValidity.INVALID_LENGTH
    assert outcome.routed_status == ROARouted.ROUTED
    outcome = trie.get_roa_outcome(ip_network("1.3.0.0/16"), routed_origin)
    assert outcome.validity == ROAValidity.UNKNOWN
    assert outcome.routed_status == ROARouted.UNKNOWN
    outcome = trie.get_roa_outcome(ip_network("1.2.0.255"), routed_origin)
    assert outcome.validity == ROAValidity.INVALID_LENGTH
    assert outcome.routed_status == ROARouted.ROUTED
```

## Installation
* [roa\_checker](#roa_checker)

Install python and pip if you have not already. Then run:

```bash
pip3 install roa_checker
```

This will install the package and all of it's python dependencies.

If you want to install the project for development:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jfuruness/roa_checker.git
cd roa_checker
pip3 install -e .[test]
pre-commit install
```

To test the development package: [Testing](#testing)


## Testing
* [roa\_checker](#roa_checker)

After installation for development:

```bash
cd roa_checker
python3 -m pytest roa_checker
ruff check roa_checker
ruff format roa_checker
```

To run all tests:

```bash
cd roa_checker
tox --skip-missing-interpreters
```

## History
* [roa\_checker](#roa_checker)

* 3.1.1 Updated dependencies and ruff settings and removed official windows support (since matplotlib doesn't work on windows with pypy in CI/CD)
* 3.1.0 Added get_roa_outcome_w_prefix_str_cached. It caches everything, don't cause a mem err!
* 3.0.2 Updated deps, testing, gh actions, etc
* 3.0.1 Updated dependencies for testing only
* 3.0.0 Added ta attribute to ROAs for the ROACollector, modified properties in the ROA for BGPy compatibility
* 2.0.0
    * Previously the ROA checker would only look at the ROAs that were the most specific prefix (and then would check all of those ROAs)
        * This is a problem because if there were two ROAs, one that is less specific and valid, and one that is more specific and invalid, the announcements would be considered invalid incorrectly.
        * Fixing this unfortunately causes some of the public methods to change (they were wrong before anyways) like get_roa (you can't get a ROA for a prefix, you need to get all ROAs for that prefix)
* 1.1.4 Bug fix for multiple ROA case where multiple ROAs would result in the least valid ROA being selected, rather than the most valid ROA being selected. Thanks for finding this Cameron Morris!
* 1.1.3 Dependency updates
* 1.1.2 Added ROA to top level import
* 1.1.1 mypy and linter fixes
* 1.1.0 Updated test deps
* 1.0.0 Updated package structure, typing, linters, etc, made ROAValidity contains multiple invalid types
* 0.0.1 First working version
