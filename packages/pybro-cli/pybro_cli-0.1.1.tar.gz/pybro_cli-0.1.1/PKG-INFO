# 😎 Yo, It's PyBro!

Welcome to the Chrome Profile Manager - part of the PyBro collection of Python hacks for Debian 24.04! 

## 🤘 What's This Bad Boy Do?

Ever got tired of clicking around Chrome to switch between your work, personal, and secret meme-browsing profiles? Say no more, fam! This tool's got your back!

### 🚀 Features That Slap:
- Create quick terminal commands for ANY Chrome profile
- Jump straight to your favorite sites
- Work with both Google and local profiles
- No more clicking through Chrome's profile menu like a peasant

## 🛠️ Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chrome-profile-manager.git

# Jump in
cd chrome-profile-manager

# Set up your virtual environment (keep it clean, fam!)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the goods
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run it!
python main.py
```

## 🎮 How to Use This Beast

1. Fire it up:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Choose your move:
- Create a new profile shortcut (with URL)
- Make a profile homepage shortcut
- See what profiles you've got
- Check the debug info if you're feeling techy

## 🎯 Example Usage

```bash
# After setting up, you'll get commands like:
work-chrome    # Launches your work profile
reddit-chrome  # Jump straight to Reddit with your meme profile
bank-chrome    # Your secure banking profile
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Use different profiles for different vibes (work, personal, development)
- Create shortcuts for your most-used sites
- Keep your profiles organized with custom names
