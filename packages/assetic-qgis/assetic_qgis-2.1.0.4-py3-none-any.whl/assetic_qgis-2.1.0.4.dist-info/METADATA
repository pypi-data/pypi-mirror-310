Log issues via Assetic Support


**Changelog**

**Release 2.1.0.4**
    *   Added optional parameter for a mapping that allows transforming geometries to an intermediate CRS, during asset create and update

**Release 2.1.0.3**
    *   Fixed an issue with the conversion of Multipoint feature geometry to WKT for the update process

**Release 2.1.0.2**
    *   Fixed a bug when trying to access a feature's geometry for bulk spatial updates via the Data Exchange

**Release 2.1.0.1**
    *   Added boolean parameter for creation of Functional Location when checking for it's existence during asset association

**Release 2.1.0.0**
    *   Added support for Component and Dimension 'upsert' where the Component and or Dimension is created as part of
        the Asset update if the Component/Dimension does not already exist.
        Requires assetic SDK 2023.16.1.2 minimum, and configuration setting to enable
    *   Where invalid polygon orientation provided for multipolyon the orientation will be corrected
        where possible

**Release 2.0.1.8**
    *   Fixed an issue when committing changes to a layer where editing mode was disabled and only partial Assetic IDs

    *   Fixed an issue with the handling of empty layer fields mapped to asset address

**Release 2.0.1.6**
    *   Option to Buffer update of layer with Assetic ID on asset creation (default option) or apply feature updates directly (set using use_buffered_edit=False)

**Release 2.0.1.5**
    *   Improve functional location config
    *   Improve reporting of unhandled exceptions

**Release 2.0.1.4**
    *   Fixed bug that was preventing dimension info being explictly added to each
        QGIS row
    *   Partial asset creation now being correctly reported to logger
    *   Queries now working correctly when creating/updating functional locations
        from layer
    *   Removed QGIS specific geometry fields from base python-sdk in to qgis package

**Release 2.0.1.3**
    *   Fixes for initialisation crash in some circumstances where logging failed

**Release 2.0.1.2**
    *   Added functionality to bulk update assets via data-exchange
