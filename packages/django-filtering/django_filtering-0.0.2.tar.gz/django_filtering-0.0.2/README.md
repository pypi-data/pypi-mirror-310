# Django Filtering

A library for filtering Django Models.

The original usecase for this project required the following:

- provides a means of allowing users to filter modeled data
- provides the ability to `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` filters (i.e. operators)
- provides the ability to group filters by operator
- serializes, validates, etc.
