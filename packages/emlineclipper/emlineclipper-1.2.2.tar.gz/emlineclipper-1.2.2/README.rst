Python library to clip emission lines in supernova spectra. Developed by Gabriel Finneran at University College Dublin, Ireland. 

A brief description of the tool is given here. Full documentation is available at `readthedocs <https://emlineclipper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. Further information may be found in `Finneran et al. (2024) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11503>`_ (see below for how to cite this work!).

This package can be installed from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/emlineclipper/>`_ using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install emlineclipper


The source code can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/GabrielF98/emlineclipper>`_. Issues can be logged `here <https://github.com/GabrielF98/emlineclipper/issues>`_.
