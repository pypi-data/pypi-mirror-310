pyscaffoldext-pre-commit-ruff
=============================

`PyScaffold`_ extension to use the `Ruff Linter`_ and `Ruff Formatter`_
in place of the `Pre Commit Extension`_, ``putup --pre-commit`` defaults
`flake8`_ and `isort`_.

The ``ruff`` configuration is added to ``pyproject.toml`` because
``ruff`` does not support ``setup.cfg``. Some `Ruff Linter`_ recommended
settings are commented out, for consistency with `PyScaffold`_'s
``flake8`` settings.

`Codespell`_ is added to `pre-commit`_ configuration in
``.pre-commit-config.yaml``; uncomment to enable.

`Mypy`_ settings are added to ``setup.cfg``.

Usage
-----

Just install this package with
``pip install pyscaffoldext-pre-commit-ruff`` and note that ``putup -h``
shows a new option ``--pre-commit-ruff``. Use this flag to use the `Ruff
Linter`_ and `Ruff Formatter`_ in place of ``putup --pre-commit``
defaults `flake8`_ and `isort`_.
