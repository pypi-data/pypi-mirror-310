# AI Agent State Library


## What is it?

The AI Agent State Library is a library designed to manage the state and decision-making processes of AI agents. At its core, it implements the concept of finite state machines, a computational model used to design systems with a finite number of states and transitions between those states.

Key features of the library include:

1. **State Machine Creation**: It allows developers to define and create intricate state machines that model the behavior of AI agents.

2. **Flexible State Definition**: States can be customized with associated data and metadata, allowing for rich context within each state.

3. **Dynamic Transitions**: The library supports the creation of transitions between states, which can be conditional and trigger specific actions.

4. **State Transition Guards**: Implement conditions that must be met for transitions to occur, providing more control over state changes.

5. **Persistence**: Integration with ChromaDB enables efficient storage and retrieval of state machines, allowing for continuity across sessions or distributed systems.

6. **Visualization**: The library includes tools to visualize state machines, aiding in debugging and understanding complex agent behaviors.

7. **OpenAI Integration**: It leverages the OpenAI API for dynamic decision-making, allowing for more intelligent and adaptive state transitions.

## When is it useful?

The AI Agent State Library proves particularly valuable in scenarios such as:

- **Conversational AI**: Managing the flow and context of conversations, ensuring coherent and contextually appropriate responses.

- **Business Process Automation**: Modeling and executing complex workflows that involve decision points and varied paths based on different conditions.

- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordinating the behavior and interactions of multiple AI agents in a complex environment.

The library's flexibility and extensibility make it adaptable to a wide range of AI applications where managing complex state and behavior is crucial. Its integration with modern tools like ChromaDB for persistence and OpenAI for decision-making enhances its utility in creating sophisticated, adaptive AI systems.

By providing a structured way to design, implement, and manage AI agent behavior, the AI Agent State Library helps developers create more reliable, understandable, and maintainable AI systems, reducing the complexity often associated with developing intelligent agents.

## Features

- Create and manage complex state machines for AI agents
- Define custom states with associated data and metadata
- Create transitions between states with optional conditions and actions
- Implement state transition guards for controlled state changes
- Persist and retrieve state machines using ChromaDB
- Visualize state machines for easy understanding and debugging
- Integration with OpenAI's API for dynamic decision-making

## Installation

To install the AI Agent State Library, use pip:

```bash
pip install ai-agent-state
```

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7+
- ChromaDB
- OpenAI
- python-dotenv
- graphviz (optional, for visualization)

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started with the AI Agent State Library. This example shows how to create a state machine and specify the OpenAI model to be used:

```python
import uuid
from ai_agent_state import State, StateData, StateMachine, Transition

# Define states
states = [
    State(
        id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
        name='initialize',
        data=StateData(data={'message': 'Initializing AI agent...'})
    ),
    State(
        id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
        name='process',
        data=StateData(data={'message': 'Processing task...'})
    ),
    State(
        id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
        name='idle',
        data=StateData(data={'message': 'Waiting for next task...'})
    ),
]

# Create the state machine and specify the model name
state_machine = StateMachine(
    name='SimpleAIAgent',
    initial_state=states[0],
    model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo'  # Replace with your desired model
)

# Add states to the state machine
for state in states:
    state_machine.add_state(state)

# Add transitions
state_machine.add_transition(Transition(from_state='initialize', to_state='process'))
state_machine.add_transition(Transition(from_state='process', to_state='idle'))
state_machine.add_transition(Transition(from_state='idle', to_state='process'))

# Use the state machine
state_machine.trigger_transition("Start processing")
print(f"Current State: {state_machine.current_state.name}")
state_machine.trigger_transition("Finish processing")
print(f"Current State: {state_machine.current_state.name}")

# Save the state machine (optional)
from ai_agent_state import ChromaStateManager
chroma_manager = ChromaStateManager(persist_directory="chroma_db")
chroma_manager.save_state_machine(state_machine)
```

```

**Explanation of the Example:**

- **State Definitions:**
  - We define several states representing different stages of the customer support interaction, such as `Welcome`, `MainMenu`, `OrderTracking`, `ProvideOrderStatus`, etc.

- **State Machine Initialization:**
  - We create a `StateMachine` instance, specifying the initial state and the OpenAI model to use.

- **Adding States and Transitions:**
  - All states and transitions are added to the state machine. Transitions define how the state machine moves from one state to another based on the conversation flow.

- **Action Functions:**
  - Functions like `fetch_order_status`, `handle_returns_and_refunds`, etc., simulate backend operations that would occur in a real-world scenario.

- **Main Conversation Loop:**
  - The `main` function runs an interactive loop where the user can input messages, and the assistant responds accordingly.
  - The assistant uses the OpenAI model specified to process messages and determine state transitions.

- **State Management:**
  - The state machine keeps track of the current state and moves to the next state based on user input and OpenAI's decision-making.
  - Actions associated with each state are performed when the state is active.

**Sample Interaction:**

```plaintext
Current State: Welcome
Welcome to E-Shop! How can I assist you today?
You: I'd like to track my order.

[Before Transition] Current State: Welcome
Assistant Response: Sure, I can help you with order tracking. Please provide your order number.
[After Transition] Current State: CollectOrderNumber
State History: Welcome -> CollectOrderNumber
You: My order number is 123456.

[Before Transition] Current State: CollectOrderNumber
Assistant Response: Thank you! Retrieving the status of your order now.
[After Transition] Current State: ProvideOrderStatus
State History: Welcome -> CollectOrderNumber -> ProvideOrderStatus
Action: Order 123456 is currently in transit and will be delivered in 2 days.
You: Great, thanks!

[Before Transition] Current State: ProvideOrderStatus
Assistant Response: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with?
[After Transition] Current State: MainMenu
State History: Welcome -> CollectOrderNumber -> ProvideOrderStatus -> MainMenu
You: No, that's all.

[Before Transition] Current State: MainMenu
Assistant Response: Thank you for visiting E-Shop! Have a great day!
[After Transition] Current State: Goodbye
State History: Welcome -> CollectOrderNumber -> ProvideOrderStatus -> MainMenu -> Goodbye

Final State History:
Welcome -> CollectOrderNumber -> ProvideOrderStatus -> MainMenu -> Goodbye
```

**Note:**

- In a real implementation, the assistant's responses and state transitions are determined by the OpenAI model based on your inputs.
- Ensure that you have set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment variables or appropriately in your code.
- Replace `'gpt-3.5-turbo'` with your desired OpenAI model.
- The action functions simulate backend processes and should be replaced with actual logic in a production environment.
