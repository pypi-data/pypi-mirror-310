# BitCrypt

**BitCrypt** is a Python library for encrypting and decrypting text strings at the bit level, with additional Base64 encoding for secure storage or transmission.

---

## Features

- Encrypt strings by inverting their bits and encoding them with Base64.
- Decrypt Base64-encoded strings back to their original form by restoring the inverted bits.
- Simple API for integration into other projects.
- CLI support for quick encryption and decryption.

## How It Works

The library performs encryption and decryption through the following steps:

### Encryption

1. **Input**: A plaintext string.
2. **Convert to Bytes**: The input string is converted to a byte sequence.
3. **Invert Bits**: Each byte's bits are flipped (using the `~` operator).
4. **Base64 Encoding**: The inverted bytes are encoded into a Base64 string for portability and security.
5. **Output**: The resulting Base64 string.

### Decryption

1. **Input**: A Base64-encoded string.
2. **Decode from Base64**: The string is decoded into its original inverted byte sequence.
3. **Restore Bits**: The inverted bits are flipped back to their original state.
4. **Convert to String**: The restored bytes are converted back into a plaintext string.
5. **Output**: The original string.

## Installation

Install the library via `pip`:

```bash
pip install bitcrypt
