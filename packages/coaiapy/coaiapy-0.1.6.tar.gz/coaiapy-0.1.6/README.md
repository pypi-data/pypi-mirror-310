 ## Plan


* --@STCGoal Centralized Access to this Small Project that attempt to build creative tooling using LLM
* --@STCMastery Prompt engineering
* --@STCMastery Distribute and Share your prompts
* --@STCIssue Prompts engineered are sparsed in many projects and forked explorations
* --@STCissue Pythonista coaiamodule is stuck in iCloudDrive and have interesting simple OpenAI API Wrapper and an interesting foundation for ways to define assistant and define their various prompt templating (in fact, it contains a way a template for the data structure with prefix and suffix attributes to define the properties of an assistant, therefore you can define a new assistant in seconds with 2 nested data structure in the config.json and add them to a Pythonista UI button just by initializing the UI Component with the 'prefix' of the assistant defined in the config (hopefully, you would be able to create a UI Component without an assistant to exist in the configuration and it would triggers a 'new assistant' design session and publish its definition when the user has completed to define its purpose.
