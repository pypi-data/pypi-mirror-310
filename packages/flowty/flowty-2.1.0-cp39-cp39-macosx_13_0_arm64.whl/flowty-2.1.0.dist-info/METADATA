        The community license described in these terms is a license to the general

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
        1. The "Program" means the modules of the Flowty network optimization
           optimization software.
        2. The license is a nonexclusive software end user license, according to which
           the licensee is entitled to use an object code copy of the licensed software
           for commercial as well as non-commercial purposes.
        3. The licensee acquires the right to use the delivered (downloaded) object
           code copy of the Program only and does not acquire any rights of ownership.
        4. The licensee shall be prohibited from sublicensing and otherwise letting
           third parties use the Program without prior written consent from the
           licensor.
        5. The licensee shall not be entitled to modify, reverse engineer, disassemble
           or decompile the Program. The licensee shall only be entitled to make copies
           of the Program for backup purposes.
        6. The licensee is not required to accept this license, since the licensee has
           not signed it. However, nothing else grants the licensee permission to use
           the Program. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
           license. Therefore, by using the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
           you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its 
           terms and conditions for the Program or works based on it.
        
        NO WARRANTY
        
        7. Because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for 
           the program to the extent permitted by applicable law. The
           copyright holders provide the program "as is" without warranty of any 
           kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
           implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
           The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is
           with you. Should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all 
           necessary servicing, repair, or correction. 
        8. In no event will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify 
           and/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to
           you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or 
           consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the 
           program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered 
           inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the
           program to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other 
           party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

# Flowty

The Flowty Optimisation Solver is a column generation based solver. It is used to solve mixed integer linear programming models formulated with (resource constrained) paths in specified graphs. The solver is well suited for solving planning & scheduling, routing and multi-commodity flow problems. The solver is written in C++ with a Python interface.

## Installation

Install with

```sh
pip install flowty
```

## License

The solver ships with a Community License that is restricted to 10 days use.
