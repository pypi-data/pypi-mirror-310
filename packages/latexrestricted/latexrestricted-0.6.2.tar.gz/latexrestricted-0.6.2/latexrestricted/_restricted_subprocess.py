    Run a command securely, consistent with TeX restricted shell escape.

        executables in this file.  If `allow_restricted_executables == True`,
        then the executable must be in the list of allowed restricted shell
        escape commands as returned by `kpsewhich` or `initexmf`.

     *  The executable must be in the same directory as `kpsewhich` or
        `initexmf`, as previously located during LaTeX config evaluation, or
        the executable must exist on PATH, as found by `shutil.which()`.

        The executable must not be in a location writable by LaTeX.  For added
        security, locations writable by LaTeX cannot be under the executable
        parent directory.

     *  The executable cannot be a batch file (no *.bat or *.cmd):
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#security-considerations.
        This is enforced in a somewhat redundant fashion by requiring *.exe
        under Windows and completely prohibiting *.bat and *.cmd everywhere.

     *  The subprocess must run with `shell=False`.
