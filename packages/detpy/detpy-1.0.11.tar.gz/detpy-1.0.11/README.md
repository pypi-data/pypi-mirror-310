# Installation
```
pip install detpy
```

# Example - optimization of the Ackley function based SADE
```
from detpy.DETAlgs.data.alg_data import SADEData

from detpy.DETAlgs.sade import SADE

from detpy.functions import FunctionLoader

from detpy.models.enums.boundary_constrain import BoundaryFixing

from detpy.models.enums.optimization import OptimizationType

from detpy.models.fitness_function import BenchmarkFitnessFunction


function_loader = FunctionLoader()

ackley_function = function_loader.get_function(function_name="ackley", n_dimensions=2)

fitness_fun = BenchmarkFitnessFunction(ackley_function)


params = SADEData(

    epoch=100,

    population_size=100,

    dimension=2,

    lb=[-32.768, -32.768],

    ub=[32.768, 32.768],

    mode=OptimizationType.MINIMIZATION,

    boundary_constraints_fun=BoundaryFixing.RANDOM,

    function=fitness_fun,

    log_population=True,

    parallel_processing=['thread', 4]

)


default2 = SADE(params, db_conn="Differential_evolution.db", db_auto_write=False)

results = default2.run()
```

# Using FunctionLoader

You can also use one of predefined functions to solve your problem. 
To do this, call the FunctionLoader method and pass as an argument the name of a function from the folder and variables,
which u want to use in your calculations.

```
function_loader = FunctionLoader()
function_name = "ackley"
variables = [0.0, 0.0]
n_dimensions = 2

result = function_loader.evaluate_function(function_name, variables, n_dimensions)
```

Available functions:

```
        self.function_classes = {
            "ackley": Ackley,
            "rastrigin": Rastrigin,
            "rosenbrock": Rosenbrock,
