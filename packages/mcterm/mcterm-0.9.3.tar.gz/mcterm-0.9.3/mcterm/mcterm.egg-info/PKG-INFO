Description: # Better Minecraft Remote Console
        
        This library utilizes SQLLite3 and Prompt Toolkit to improve upon the mccron package.
        Several improvements have been made to include history, word completion, and an 
        extensive database for many Minecraft console commands. 
        
        **The database is required in order to run this tool.**
        
        ## Cloning the Repository
        
        You must have git installed.
        
        ```
        git clone https://newgit.inuxnet.org/devel/bettermcrcon.git
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install this library locally by issuing the following command. It is recommended 
        to use a python virtual environment. 
        
        ### Setting up and activating the Python Virtual Environment
        
        You must have Python Virtual Environment installed, please review your specific OS 
        instructions to install VirtualEnv on your system.
        
        From the directory of the repository:
        
        ```
        python3 -m venv venv
        ```
        
        Depending on your OS you may need to source different files. These are located in 
        `venv\scripts` on Windows and `venv/bin` on Unix, Linux and OSX.
        
        Windows Command Line:
        ```
        venv\scripts\activate.bat
        ```
        
        Windows Powershell:
        ```
        . venv\scripts\activate.ps1
        ```
        
        Unix, Linux, OSX:
        ```
        . venv/bin/activate
        ```
        
        To exit the Virtual Environment:
        
        ```
        deactivate
        ```
        
        ### Installing using the setup.py
        
        All commands should be run from the root directory of the repository.
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        ### Installing from [PyPi](https://pypi.org)
        
        ```
        pip install mcterm
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        Installation will install `mcterm` inside the bin path and should be accessible. 
        The database must be created or installed. If the database cannot be found, 
        `mcterm` will attempt to create by locating or downloading the SQL Dump of the 
        database. If this fails, the program will not run.
        
        ```
        Usage: mcterm [--host <value>] [--port <value>] [--password <value>] [--prompt <value>]
        
            --host     - The hostname or IP of the Minecraft Server
            --port     - The port of the Minecraft Server is listening on for Console.
            --password - The password for the server.
            --prompt   - Custom Prompt (Defaults to '<host>:<port> >>> ')
        ```
            
        Example Usage:
        
        ```
        mcterm
        ```
        
        ```
        mcterm --host 192.168.1.3 --port 11111
        ```
        
        ```
        mcterm --host 192.168.1.3 --port 11111 --password 'secretpassword'
        ```
        
        ```
        mcterm --host 192.168.1.3 --port 11111 --password 'secretpassword' --prompt 'MyServer >>> '
        ```
