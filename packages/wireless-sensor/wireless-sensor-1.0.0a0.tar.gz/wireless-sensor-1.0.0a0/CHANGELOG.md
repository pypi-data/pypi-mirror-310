## [Unreleased]
### Added
- added attribute type hints to `Measurement` class
- declare compatibility with `python3.11`

### Changed
- method `FT017TH.receive`
  - now async
  - quits after `timeout_seconds` without valid packet
  - `gpiod_line_request_rising_edge_events` (within `cc1101` library) blocks
    thread for up to `timeout_seconds`
  - no longer yields `None`
- command `wireless-sensor-receive`: timeout after one hour without valid packet

### Removed
- compatibility with `python3.5`, `python3.6`, `python3.7` & `python3.8`

## [0.4.0] - 2021-04-22
### Changed
- `FT017TH.receive`: use edge detection on CC1101's `GDO0` pin to detect arrival of packages
  (instead of polling)
- command `wireless-sensor-receive`: added parameter `--gdo0-gpio-line-name` (default: `GPIO24`)
- `FT017TH.receive`: yield `None` on error or timeout to allow caller to perform periodic tasks
  (instead of blocking thread until valid packet arrives)

## [0.3.0] - 2020-12-11
### Changed
- acquire `flock` on SPI device file
- attribute `FT017TH.transceiver` is now private

### Added
- added option `FT017TH(unlock_spi_device=True)` / `--unlock-spi-device`
  to release the `flock` from the SPI device file after configuring the transceiver

### Fixed
- reconfigure receiver after receiving a packet with unexpected length
  (receiver possibly accessed by other process)

## [0.2.0] - 2020-12-07
### Added
- `Measurement` type is now public

## [0.1.1] - 2020-12-07
### Fixed
- `ValueError: astimezone() cannot be applied to a naive datetime` on python3.5

## [0.1.0] - 2020-02-07
### Added
- method `wireless_sensor.FT017TH.receive` continuously yielding
  temperature & humidity measurements received from FT017TH sensor
- script `wireless-sensor-receive`
