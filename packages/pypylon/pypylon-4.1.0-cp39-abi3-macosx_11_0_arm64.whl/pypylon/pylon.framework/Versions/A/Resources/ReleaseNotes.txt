RELEASE DATE:       2024-10-30

VERSION:            7.3.2 (macOS 11.7, 12.6, 13.4)

################################################################################


BINARY COMPATIBILITY
====================
* pylon C++ API = 7.3.2: Applications built with earlier versions of the pylon C++
  API are incompatible.


CORRECTIONS
===========
* GigE Vision: [313324] Fixed a bug that caused a data encoding error when using
                        the Compression Beyond feature on GigE cameras.


RESTRICTIONS
============
* pylon Viewer: No pylon Viewer and GUI tools are included. Please use previous versions of
                pylon to make use of any GUI tools.
* GigE Vision: [259058] For optimum use of Basler's ace 2 5GigE and 1GigE cameras,
               Basler recommends using dual-channel DDR4-3600 RAM or better.
               Using slower RAM may cause buffer underruns and image loss.
* GigE Vision: Multiple IP configurations on a single network interface are not
       fully supported by the IP Configurator tool.
* Setup: If the *.pkg package fails to install, right-click the *.pkg package and select
         Open to continue. This may occur if macOS can’t read the Basler certificate.
* SDK: Some ace 2 cameras may use a boolean parameter instead of the usual enumeration
       for event notifications. The following code snippets can be used to work around
       this issue.
       For C++ you can use:
         CBooleanParameter(camera.GetNodeMap(), "EventNotification").TrySetValue(true);
       in addition to:
         camera.EventNotification.TrySetValue(EventNotification_On);
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support action commands.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support multicast configurations.
* BPD: The Basler Product Documentation requires advanced JavaScript support. Please
       use a modern browser, e.g., Firefox 44 (or higher), or Chrome 49 (or higher).

BINARY COMPATIBILITY
====================
* pylon C++ API = 7.3.1: Applications built with earlier versions of the pylon C++
  API are incompatible.


NEW FEATURES / CHANGES
======================
* General: Added support for Apple silicon.
* General: Added support for macOS Monterey (12.6) and Ventura (13.4).
* GigE Vision: [241034] New Basler ace 2 5GigE cameras are supported.
* GigE Vision: [201685] The pylon GEV socket driver has been updated. This driver
               supports all 1GigE, 5GigE, and 10GigE network adapters. Basler
               recommends using Basler network adapters for best performance
               and reliability.
* GigE Vision: [201685] The updated pylon GEV socket driver supports the following new features:
               - Better packet resend mechanisms

* Camera Emulation: [191663] The pylon Camera Emulation has been updated with multiple new
                    parameters to better reflect the behavior of recent Basler cameras,
                    e.g., ace 2 camera models.
* Camera Emulation: [239196, 239198, 239199, 239200, 239201, 239203, 239204, 239207,
                    247311, 247312] The pylon Camera Emulation has been updated with
                    several new parameters to better reflect the behavior of recent
                    Basler cameras, e.g., ace 2 camera models.
* BPD: [245922] The pylon SDK Samples Manual has been moved to the Basler Product
       Documentation.

                has been adapted to correctly display the brightness range when using the
                Basler SLP Strobe Controller.
* pylon Viewer: [182085] The position of GigE cameras in the Devices pane does not change
                anymore after enumeration.
* pylon Viewer: [189875] The pylon Viewer can grab images after changing the IP address of
                the network adapter without having to close and reopen the pylon Viewer.
                The refresh button must be clicked before opening the camera if Auto-Scan
                is disabled.
* pylon Viewer: [189905] Fixed an issue with the "Don't show this dialog again" option in
                the Bandwidth Manager.


RESTRICTIONS
=========================
* Setup: If the *.pkg package fails to install, right-click the *.pkg package and select
         Open to continue. This may occur if macOS can’t read the Basler certificate.
* SDK: Some ace 2 cameras may use a boolean parameter instead of the usual enumeration
       for event notifications. The following code snippets can be used to work around
       this issue.
       For C++ you can use:
         CBooleanParameter(camera.GetNodeMap(), "EventNotification").TrySetValue(true);
       in addition to:
         camera.EventNotification.TrySetValue(EventNotification_On);
* GigE Vision: On some macOS Catalina versions, e.g., 10.15.4, the camera enumeration in the
       pylon Viewer or the pylon API may take longer than 60 seconds. To prevent that either
       use an older macOS version or check for future macOS updates.
* pylon Viewer: The pylon Viewer requires macOS version 10.13 or newer.
* pylon Viewer: To use the pylon Viewer, you must install the latest Mesa OpenGL driver for
        your system.
* pylon Viewer: Clicking Reset Window Layout while running the pylon Viewer in full-screen mode,
        will minimize the pylon Viewer and the image window may disappear and become undocked.
        You may need to stop/start the image acquisition to display the image window again.
        To avoid this, Basler recommends using the Reset Window Layout feature only when the
        pylon Viewer is not in full-screen mode.
* IP Configurator: The IP Configurator tool requires macOS version 10.12 or newer.
* GigE Vision: Multiple IP configurations on a single network interface are not
       fully supported by the IP Configurator tool.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support action commands.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support multicast configurations.
* BPD: When using the offline Basler Product Documentation with the Safari browser on macOS
       Catalina 10.15.x, the forwarding to the BPD and any internal links will not work correctly.
       To fix the forwarding issue, choose Safari > Preferences > Advanced. Select “Show Develop
       menu in menu bar”. In the Safari menu bar, choose Develop > Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions.
* BPD: The Basler Product Documentation requires advanced JavaScript support. Please
       use a modern browser, e.g., Firefox 44 (or higher), or Chrome 49 (or higher).
