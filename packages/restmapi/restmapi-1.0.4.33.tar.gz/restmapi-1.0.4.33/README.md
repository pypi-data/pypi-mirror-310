# REST MAPI Package

REST MAPI (MORPHEE API) package allows to control MORPHEE at runtime using MORPHEE REST API. MAPI main principle is to provide so called MAPI services. From MAPI, you should first ask for a specific service before using it. 

:information_source: Each service has access rights that could be set in UEditor.

	if morphee_process_control.is_morphee_process_started() != True:
		morphee_process_control.start()
```
