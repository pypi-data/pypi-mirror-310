**To start contibuting, theres multiple tutorials for your os so scroll down until you choose the proper tutorial.**
---
## **Windows**
1. Firstly, [click here to download git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and then run the setup file.
2. After completing the setup process, we will open cmd by pressing ```Win + R``` on your keyboard and then type ```cmd``` and click the ```run``` button.
3. You will see the cmd window appearing. In your cmd, type ```cd C:\Users\{replace-this-part-with-your-windows-username}```, then type ```mkdir pythonult```, ```cd pythonult``` and finally ```git clone https://github.com/lamps-dev/utl.git```.
4. You're done! :D. Happy contributing on windows!

## **Linux**
1. Firstly, depending on your linux distro, it may be either already installed or not installed. If its not installed, [go here to have the guide for your distro.](https://git-scm.com/downloads/linux)
2. After installing git, on your terminal, type ```cd ~```, then type ```mkdir pythonult```, ```cd pythonult``` and finally ```git clone https://github.com/lamps-dev/utl.git```.
4. You're done! :D. Happy contributing on linux!

## **MacOS**
1. First, you'll need to install Git. MacOS might prompt you to install developer tools (which includes Git) when you first try to use it. Alternatively, you can download Git from [the official website](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) or install it via Homebrew using:
```bash
brew install git
```

2. After installing Git, open Terminal (you can find it in Applications > Utilities > Terminal, or use Spotlight Search with Command + Space and type "Terminal")

3. In your terminal, run these commands:
```bash
cd ~
mkdir pythonult
cd pythonult
git clone https://github.com/lamps-dev/utl.git
```

4. You're done! :D. Happy contributing on MacOS!

## **Solaris**
1. Install Git using the OpenCSW package manager:
   ```bash
   pkgadd -d http://get.opencsw.org/now
   /opt/csw/bin/pkgutil -U
   /opt/csw/bin/pkgutil -y -i git
   ```

2. After installing git, run these commands:
   ```bash
   cd ~
   mkdir pythonult
   cd pythonult
   git clone https://github.com/lamps-dev/utl.git
   ```

3. You're done! :D. Happy contributing on Solaris!

## **FreeBSD**
1. Install Git using pkg:
   ```bash
   pkg install git
   ```

2. After installing git, run these commands:
   ```bash
   cd ~
   mkdir pythonult
   cd pythonult
   git clone https://github.com/lamps-dev/utl.git
   ```

3. You're done! :D. Happy contributing on FreeBSD!

## **Android**
1. Install Termux from the Google Play Store or F-Droid

2. Open Termux and run these commands:
   ```bash
   pkg update && pkg upgrade
   pkg install git
   cd ~
   mkdir pythonult
   cd pythonult
   git clone https://github.com/lamps-dev/utl.git
   ```

3. You're done! :D. Happy contributing on Android!

## **iOS**
1. Due to iOS restrictions, you'll need to use a development environment like:
   - Working Copy (Git client for iOS)
   - iSH (Linux shell for iOS)
   - Or use cloud-based solutions like GitHub Codespaces

2. If using iSH, run these commands:
   ```bash
   apk add git
   cd ~
   mkdir pythonult
   cd pythonult
   git clone https://github.com/lamps-dev/utl.git
   ```

3. If using Working Copy:
   - Add your GitHub credentials
   - Clone the repository using the URL: https://github.com/lamps-dev/utl.git
   - You can then edit files directly in the app

4. You're done! :D. Happy contributing on iOS!


## **Google TV**
1. Since Google TV doesn't have direct access to a terminal, you have two main options:
   - Use Android Debug Bridge (ADB) from a connected computer
   - Use a cloud-based development environment like GitHub Codespaces

2. If using ADB method:
   - Enable Developer Options on your Google TV (Go to Settings > System > About and tap Build Number 7 times)
   - Enable USB Debugging in Developer Options
   - Connect to your Google TV using ADB from your computer:
   ```bash
   adb connect <your-google-tv-ip>
   cd ~
   mkdir pythonult
   cd pythonult
   git clone https://github.com/lamps-dev/utl.git

3. If using GitHub Codespaces:
Visit github.com
Navigate to the repository: https://github.com/lamps-dev/utl.git Click on Code > Codespaces > Create codespace

4. You're done! :D. Happy contributing on Google TV!

## **Arch Linux Console Mode**
1. Since you're in console mode, you already have access to the terminal

2. Install git if not already installed:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S git
   ```

3. After installing git, run these commands:
   ```bash
   cd ~
   mkdir pythonult
   cd pythonult
   git clone https://github.com/lamps-dev/utl.git
   ```

4. You're done! :D. Happy contributing on Arch Linux Console Mode!

## **DigitalOcean**
1. Connect to your DigitalOcean droplet via SSH:
   ```bash
   ssh root@your-droplet-ip

2. Install git (if not already installed):
```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian-based droplets
apt-get update
apt-get install git -y
   
# For CentOS/RHEL-based droplets
yum install git -y
```

3. After installing git, run these commands:
```bash
cd ~
mkdir pythonult
cd pythonult
git clone https://github.com/lamps-dev/utl.git
```
4. You're done! :D. Happy contributing on DigitalOcean!
