Members within the group of Licensee Developers can be replaced with alternative members as long\n            as the number of concurrent Licensee Developers at any time does not exceed the limit set out in the\n            relevant Quote. For the purposes of this limit, each developer modifying JavaScript code as part of the\n            creation or Modification of an Application's user interface, which user interface creation or\n            Modification uses the Software shall constitute a separate Licensee Developer. For example, if the\n            Licensee has five developers working with JavaScript code with respect to the creation or Modification\n            of the user interface of an Application and such creation or Modification uses the Software, but only\n            two developers are directly working with the Software, all five developers will be counted as Licensee\n            Developers.\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n        <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm;\" id=\"3.3\">3.3</td>\n        <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm;\">Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, if the relevant Quote specifies\n            that a Deployment Licence Add-On is being granted by the Licensor to the Licensee then:\n            <table>\n                <tr style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n                    <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm; padding-right: 3mm;\">(a)</td>\n                    <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm;\">subject to this clause <a\n                            style=\"text-decoration: none; color:black;\" href=\"#3.3\">3.3</a>, the licence granted in\n                        clause <a style=\"text-decoration: none; color:black;\" href=\"#3.2\">3.2</a> shall be\n                        sub-licensable and subject to the limit on the number of permitted Production Environment(s)\n                        set out in the relevant Quote;\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n                    <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm;\">(b)</td>\n                    <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm;\">subject to this clause <a\n                            style=\"text-decoration: none; color:black;\" href=\"#3.3\">3.3</a> and clause <a\n                            style=\"text-decoration: none; color:black;\" href=\"#3.4.a\">3.4(a)</a>, the Deployment\n                        Licence Add-On shall be subject to the same applicable licence restrictions as set out\n                        in these Terms; and\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n                    <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm;\">(c)</td>\n                    <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm;\">the Licensee shall ensure (and shall procure that its Affiliates\n                        shall ensure) that the terms of any sub-licence are in writing and are substantially the\n                        same and as restrictive as the terms of these Terms (except that the sub-licensee shall not\n                        have the right to sub-licence its rights).\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n            </table>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n        <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm;\" id=\"3.4\">3.4</td>\n        <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm;\">The Licensee and its Affiliates may use the Software Materials to install,\n            load, launch, access, run, execute, operate, and archive the Software Materials for production, test,\n            archival, emergency re-start and disaster recovery purposes and to develop and create derivative works\n            from the Software Materials in the form of Applications, provided that:\n            <table>\n                <tr style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n                    <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm; padding-right: 3mm;\" id=\"3.4.a\">(a)</td>\n                    <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm;\">unless the relevant Quote specifies that a Deployment Licence\n                        Add-On is being granted by the Licensor to the Licensee, any Application created must be\n                        used for the Licensee's and its Affiliates' internal business purposes only and must not\n                        be licensed to third parties; and\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n                    <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm;\">(b)</td>\n                    <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm;\">the Licensee and its Affiliates shall not permit any end user of\n                        any Application to use the Software independently of, or by or with any applications other\n                        than, the Application being used by that end user.\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n            </table>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n        <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm;\" id=\"3.5\">3.5</td>\n        <td style=\"padding-top: 3mm;\">For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensee and its Affiliates shall be permitted\n            to create Modifications to the Source Code to the Software for the Licensee's (and its Affiliates') use\n            of the Software in accordance with these Terms.
