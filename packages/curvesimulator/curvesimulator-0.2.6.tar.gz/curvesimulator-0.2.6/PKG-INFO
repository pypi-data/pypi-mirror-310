A Star System and Lightcurve Simulator

Curvesimulator produces a video of the movements and eclipses of celestial bodies and of the 
resulting lightcurve.
The video shows simultanously a view of the star system from the top and from the side and
the lightcurve of the system's total luminosity over time.

Check the documentation on the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/lichtgestalter/curvesimulator/wiki).

Run just 2 lines of python code to produce the video.
Specify the physical properties of some stars and planets and their orbits in a 
configuration file. The meaning of all configuration parameters 
is documented in the wiki and in an example config file.

Curvesimulator is fast and the videos use little disk space. A video takes about the same time 
to produce as its playing time and uses less than 0.5 MB disc space per minute.

Curvesim uses ffmpeg to convert the data into a video. 
Download ffmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).
Extract the downloaded zip file and (on Windows) add "yourdriveandpath\FFmpeg\bin" to the 
environment variable PATH.
