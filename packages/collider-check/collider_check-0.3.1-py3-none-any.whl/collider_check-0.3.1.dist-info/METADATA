## Overview

A small package that provides functions to check the observables in a collider, using a collider built with [Xsuite](https://github.com/xsuite) as input (must be a json file). Very useful for debugging purposes before/after tracking, and used as a backend of the [simulation dashboard](https://github.com/ColasDroin/simulation-dashboard).

## Installation

The package is available from PyPI, so you can install it with pip:

```bash
pip install collider-check
```

## Usage

You can import the package in your python script and load a collider with:

```python
import collider_check
check = collider_check.from_json("path/to/collider.json")
```

To get a quick summary of the collider observables, use:

```python
check.output_check_as_str('output.txt')
```
