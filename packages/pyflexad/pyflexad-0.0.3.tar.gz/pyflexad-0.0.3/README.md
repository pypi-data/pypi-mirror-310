## About

The software package PyFlexAD is designed to apply the vertex-based aggregation of various energy storage devices for optimization purposes. 
The software is implemented in the Python 3 programming language and licensed under the MIT license. 
The python package is available for download from the Python Project Index (PyPI). 
The source code and additional materials can be accessed on [GitHub](https://github.com/rce-fhv/pyflexad).

## Further Information

### Energy Storage and Subclasses

The package supports multiple types of energy storage systems, including BESS’s, TCL’s, EV’s and PHES’s. 
These models extend the general EnergyStorage class. 
The package focuses on modeling energy storage systems and does not include energy resources without storage properties. 
Inflexible/non-steerable loads are either included as power demand of the devices (e.g. EV’s or TCLH’s) 
or must be managed by the optimizing entity alongside the energy storage systems. 
In order to calculate the general parameters of an energy storing system hardware and usage parameters must be provided. 
Each subclass of EnergyStorage requires a specific set of parameters 
e.g. to instantiate the class StationaryBattery instances of BESSHardware and BESSUsage are required. 
For ease of use, the package already includes a sample of hardware parameters for models from BESS manufacturers 
like Tesla and GENERAC, of EV manufactures like Tesla, Nissan and Renault for EV models, 
and generic air conditioning and water heaters for TCL models.

### Abstraction via Virtualization

A fundamental concept in the PyFlexAD package is the virtualization of energy storage systems. 
This involves abstracting individual physical energy storages into virtual representations, 
which encapsulate the essential characteristics of the physical devices. 
The virtualization process begins with the calculation of polytope extreme actions 
to delineate the feasible operation regions of energy storage systems. 
Polytope vertices of energy storages can be approximated effectively 
using the inner-approximation by vertex-generation algorithm (IABVG) and a set of direction vectors J. 
This approximation of vertices to extreme actions is crucial 
since the calculation of exact vertices becomes computationally intractable with increasing dimensions.
By utilizing extreme actions, the computational effort required for flexibility optimization is significantly reduced. 
Moreover, calculating the extreme actions can be parallelized for each energy storage device, 
further decreasing the computational load on the optimization entity.


### Flexibility Provision via Aggregation

To describe the collective flexibility of virtual energy storages, their corresponding extreme actions are summed, 
resulting in an aggregate virtual energy storage. 
This aggregated virtual energy storage can be controlled like a virtual power plant 
and enables the optimization entity to optimize power profiles across the entire system.
