# GRAMI-AI: Adaptive AI Agent Orchestration Framework

## Overview

GRAMI-AI is a cutting-edge, async-first AI agent framework designed to solve complex computational challenges through intelligent, collaborative agent interactions. Built with unprecedented flexibility, this library empowers developers to create sophisticated, context-aware AI systems that can adapt, learn, and collaborate across diverse domains.

## Key Innovations

- **Modular Agent Architecture**: Seamlessly compose and deploy AI agents with dynamic capabilities
- **Multi-Provider LLM Integration**: Leverage models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and more
- **Async-First Design**: High-performance, non-blocking agent interactions
- **Extensible Tool Ecosystem**: Easily integrate custom tools and expand agent capabilities
- **Advanced Memory Management**: Intelligent context retention and retrieval

## Use Cases

While initially conceived for marketing and growth solutions, GRAMI-AI's flexible architecture supports a wide range of applications:
- Marketing Intelligence
- Research Automation
- Complex Problem Solving
- Interactive AI Assistants
- Cross-Domain Knowledge Synthesis

## Installation

```bash
pip install grami-ai
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Agent Creation

```python
import asyncio
from grami_ai.core.agent import AsyncAgent

async def main():
    # Create an AI agent for marketing
    agent = await AsyncAgent.create(
        name="MarketingAssistant",
        llm="gemini",
        tools=["content_generation", "web_search"]
    )

    # Generate marketing content
    response = await agent.process({
        "type": "content_request",
        "platform": "instagram",
        "niche": "tech",
        "content_type": "post"
    })

    print(response)

# Run the agent
asyncio.run(main())
```
