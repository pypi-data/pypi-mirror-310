=== Display Matplotlib plots in ImGui

link:{url-bindings-python}/imgui_fig.py[imgui_fig.py] is a small utility to display Matplotlib plots in ImGui.

See link:{url-bindings-python}/demos_python/demos_immapp/demo_matplotlib.py[demo_matplotlib.py] for an example.

=== Pure python backends

link:{url-bindings-python}/python_backends[python_backends] contains pure python backends for glfw, pyglet and sdl2. They do not offer the same DPI handling as HelloImGui, but they are a good starting point if you want to use alternative backends.

See link:{url-bindings-python}/python_backends/examples[examples] for more information.
