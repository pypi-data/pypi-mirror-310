== Closing words

=== Who is this project for

Dear ImGui Bundle aims to make applications prototyping fast and easy, in a multiplatform / multi-tooling context. The intent is to reduce the time between an idea and a first GUI prototype down to almost zero.

It is well adapted for

* developers and researchers who want to switch easily between and research and development environment by facilitating the port of research artifacts
* beginners and developers who want to quickly develop an application without learning a GUI framework

==== Who is this project *not* for

You should prefer a more complete framework (such as Qt for example) if your intent is to build a fully fledged application, with support for internationalization, advanced styling, etc.

Also, the library makes no guarantee of ABI stability, and its API is opened to slight adaptations and breaking changes if they are found to make the overall usage better and/or safer.

=== Acknowledgments

Dear ImGui Bundle would not be possible without the work of the authors of "Dear ImGui", and especially https://www.miracleworld.net/[Omar Cornut].

It also includes a lot of other projects, and I'd like to thank their authors for their awesome work!

=== Alternatives

https://pyimgui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[pyimgui] provides battle-tested comprehensive python bindings for ImGui. I worked with this project a lot, and contributed a bit to it. In the end, I had to develop a separate project, in order to be able to add auto-generated and auto-documented python modules.


https://dearpygui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Dear PyGui]  (https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui[repository]) provides python bindings for ImGui with a lot of addons, and a more pythonesque API, which makes it perhaps more suited for Python only projects.

=== About the author
Dear ImGui Bundle is developed by Pascal Thomet. I am reachable on my https://github.com/pthom[Github page]. I sometimes http://code-ballads.net/[blog]. There is a https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaJx_KrDECZPzttQ77Gv8DD7OAUwmtWUc[playlist] related to ImGui Bundle on YouTube.

I have a past in computer vision, and a lot of experience in the trenches between development and research teams; and I found ImGui to be a nice way to reduce the delay between a research prototype and its use in production code.

I also have an inclination for self documenting code, and the doc you are reading was a way to explore new ways to document projects.


=== How is Dear ImGui Bundle developed

The development of the initial version of Dear ImGui Bundle took about one year at full time.

The bindings are auto-generated thanks to an advanced parser, so that they are easy to keep up to date.

Please be tolerant if you find issues! Dear ImGui Bundle is developed for free, under a very permissive license, by one main author (and most of its API comes from external libraries).

If you need consulting about this library or about the bindings generator in the context of a commercial project, please contact me by email.

Contributions are welcome!

==== History
Three of my past projects gave me the idea to develop this library.

* https://pthom.github.io/imgui_manual_online/manual/imgui_manual.html[ImGui Manual], an interactive manual for Dear ImGui, which I developed in June 2020
* https://traineq.org/implot_demo/src/implot_demo.html[implot demo] which I developed in 2020.
* https://github.com/pthom/imgui_datascience[imgui_datascience], a python package I developed in 2018 for image analysis and debugging. Its successor is immvision.

Developments for Dear ImGui Bundle and its related automatic binding generator began in january 2022.
