link:https://github.com/ocornut/imgui_test_engine[ImGui Test Engine] is a Tests & Automation Engine for Dear ImGui.


This demo source code is heavily documented and should be self-explanatory. It shows how to:

* enable ImGui Test Engine via RunnerParams.use_imgui_test_engine
* define a callback where the tests are registered (runner_params.callbacks.register_tests)
* create tests, and:
    ** automate actions using "named references" (see https://github.com/ocornut/imgui_test_engine/wiki/Named-References)
    ** display an optional custom GUI for a test
* manipulate custom variables
* check that simulated actions do modify those variables

NOTE: See link:https://github.com/ocornut/imgui_test_engine/blob/main/imgui_test_engine/LICENSE.txt[Dear ImGui Test Engine License]. (TL;DR: free for individuals, educational, open-source and small businesses uses. Paid for larger businesses)
