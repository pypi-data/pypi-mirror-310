== Assets

HelloImGui and ImmApp applications rely on the presence of an `assets` folder.

**This folder stores**

* All the resources (images, fonts, etc.) used by the application. Feel free to add any resources there!
* The application settings (e.g. the app icon, the app settings for macOS and iOS, etc.)

**Assets folder location**

* **Python**: Place the assets folder in the same folder as the script
* **{cpp}**: The assets folder should be placed in the same folder as the CMakeLists.txt for the application (the one calling `imgui_bundle_add_app`)


**Typical layout of the assets folder**

**If needed, change the assets folder location:**

* **Python**: Call `hello_imgui.set_assets_folder()` at startup.
* **{cpp}**: Call `HelloImGui::SetAssetsFolder` at startup. Or specify its location in CMake via `imgui_bundle_add_app(app_name file.cpp ASSETS_LOCATION "path/to/assets")`.


**Where to find the default assets**

You can link:https://traineq.org/ImGuiBundle/assets.zip[download the default assets as a zip file].

Look at the folder link:https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/assets[imgui_bundle/bindings/imgui_bundle/assets] to see their content.

=== App icon and app settings ({cpp} only)

_The assets folder is deployed automatically during the build; so that they are available automatically whatever the platform._


==== App icon
The app icon is defined by the file `icon.png` in the `assets/app_settings` folder. It should be square and at least 256x256 (but 512x512 is preferred).

`icon.png` will define the application icon as well as the window icon. It will be converted to the right format for each platform by CMake (via `imgui_bundle_add_app`).


See link:{url-bundle-doc-tree}/bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_python/demo_packaging[this demo] for an example showing how to package a python application.

==== App settings

**macOS and iOS**

The app settings are defined by the file `Info.plist` in the `assets/app_settings/apple` folder.

You can copy and edit this link:{url-bundle-doc-tree}/bindings/imgui_bundle/assets/app_settings/apple/Info.plist[example] by adding your own settings (replace `${HELLO_IMGUI_BUNDLE_XXX}` by your own values).

You can also specify different settings for macOS and iOS via `Info.macos.plist` and `Info.ios.plist`
