**Key Features**

* **A lot of widgets and libraries:** All of Dear ImGui along with a suite of additional libraries for plotting, node editing, markdown rendering, and much more.

* **Always up-to-date:** The libraries are always very close to the latest version of Dear ImGui. This is also true for Python developers, since the bindings are automatically generated.

* **Interactive Demos and Documentation:** Quickly get started with our interactive manual and demos that showcase the capabilities of the pack. Read or copy-paste the source code (Python and C++) directly from the interactive manual!

* **Cross-platform:** Works on Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, and WebAssembly!

* **Easy to use, yet very powerful:** Start your first app in 3 lines. The Immediate Mode GUI (IMGUI) paradigm is simple and powerful, letting you focus on the creative aspects of your projects.

* **Fast:** Rendering is done via OpenGL (or any other renderer you choose), through native code.

* **Beautifully documented Python bindings and stubs:** The Python bindings stubs reflect the C++ API and documentation, serving as a reference and aiding autocompletion in your IDE. See for example the https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/imgui/$$__init__$$.pyi[stubs for imgui], and https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/hello_imgui.pyi[for hello_imgui] (which complete the https://pthom.github.io/hello_imgui/book/intro.html[hello_imgui manual]).
