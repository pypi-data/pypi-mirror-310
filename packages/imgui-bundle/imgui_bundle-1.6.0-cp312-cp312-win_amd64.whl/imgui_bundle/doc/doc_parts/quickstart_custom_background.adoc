TIP: As shown in the screenshot, Hello ImGui is able to display a custom 3D scene in the background. This is done by using a dedicated callback.

This demonstration showcases how to:

- Display a 3D scene in the background via the callback `runnerParams.callbacks.CustomBackground`
- Load and compile a shader
- Adjust uniforms in the GUI

Its source code is heavily documented and should be self-explanatory.
