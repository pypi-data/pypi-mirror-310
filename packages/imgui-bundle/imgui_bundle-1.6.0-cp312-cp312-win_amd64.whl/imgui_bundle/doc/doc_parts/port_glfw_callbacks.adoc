=== Advanced glfw callbacks

When using the glfw backend, you can set advanced callbacks on all glfw events.

Below is an example that triggers a callback whenever the window size is changed:

[source,python]
----
from imgui_bundle import glfw_utils, hello_imgui, imgui
# import glfw   # if you import glfw, do it _after_ imgui_bundle


# define a callback
def my_window_size_callback(window: glfw._GLFWwindow, w: int, h: int):
    print(f"Window size changed to {w}x{h}")


def install_glfw_callbacks():
    # Get the glfw window used by hello imgui
    glfw_win = glfw_utils.glfw_window_hello_imgui()
    glfw_utils.glfw.set_window_size_callback(glfw_win, my_window_size_callback)


# Install the callback once everything is initialized, for example:
runner_params = hello_imgui.RunnerParams()
# ...
runner_params.callbacks.post_init = install_glfw_callbacks
----

CAUTION: It is important to import glfw _after_ imgui_bundle, since - upon import - imgui_bundle informs glfw that it shall use its own version of the glfw dynamic library.
