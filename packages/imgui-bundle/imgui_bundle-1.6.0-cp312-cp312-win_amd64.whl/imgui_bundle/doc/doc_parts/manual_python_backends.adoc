=== Python: alternative backends

HelloImGui and ImmApp use glfw as a default backend.

If you wish to use a different backend, it is possible to use sdl2 or pyglet, via _pure python backends_.

The link:{url-bundle-doc-tree}/bindings/imgui_bundle/python_backends[python backends] folder contains a set of python backends, that can be used as a replacement for the default glfw backend. This way you will have complete control on your application (they are inspired from link:https://github.com/pyimgui/pyimgui[pyimgui] backends).

NOTE: In this case, you will not benefit from HelloImGui and ImmApp rapid development features (HighDPI support, layout management, automatic idling, etc...).
