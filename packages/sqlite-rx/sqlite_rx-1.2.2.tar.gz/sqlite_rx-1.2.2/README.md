# Introduction

[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is a lightweight database written in C. 
Python has in-built support to interact with the database (locally) which is either stored on disk or in memory.

With `sqlite_rx`, clients should be able to communicate with an `SQLiteServer` in a fast, simple and secure manner and execute queries remotely.

Key Features

- Client and Server for [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database built using [ZeroMQ](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all) as the transport layer and [msgpack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) for serialization/deserialization.
- Authentication using [ZeroMQ Authentication Protocol (ZAP)](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:27/ZAP/)
- Encryption using [CurveZMQ](http://curvezmq.org/)
- Generic authorization policy during server startup
- Schedule regular backups for on-disk databases

# Install

```commandline
pip install -U sqlite_rx
```

# Server

`SQLiteServer` runs in a single thread and follows an event-driven concurrency model (using `tornado's` event loop) which minimizes the cost of concurrent client connections. Following snippet shows how you can start the server process.

```python
# server.py

from sqlite_rx.server import SQLiteServer

def main():

    # database is a path-like object giving the pathname 
    # of the database file to be opened. 
    
    # You can use ":memory:" to open a database connection to a database 
    # that resides in RAM instead of on disk

    server = SQLiteServer(database=":memory:",
                          bind_address="tcp://127.0.0.1:5000")
    server.start()
    server.join()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

# Client

The following snippet shows how you can instantiate an `SQLiteClient` and execute a simple `CREATE TABLE` query.

```python
# client.py

from sqlite_rx.client import SQLiteClient

client = SQLiteClient(connect_address="tcp://127.0.0.1:5000")

with client:
  query = "CREATE TABLE stocks (date text, trans text, symbol text, qty real, price real)"
  result = client.execute(query)

```

```text
>> python client.py

{'error': None, 'items': []}
```
