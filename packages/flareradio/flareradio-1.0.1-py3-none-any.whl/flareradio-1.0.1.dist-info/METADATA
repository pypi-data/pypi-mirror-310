# Flare Radio Python Module

## Description
A Python package that allows you to interact with the Flare Radio API. The API is currently limited, but more features will be added over time. Please ensure you regularly update this package to stay current.

## Installation
```bash
pip install flareradio
```

## Usage
There are currently two functions: `stats()` and `upcoming()`. Both are simple to use:
- `stats()`: Retrieves the currently playing song on Flare Radio.
- `upcoming()`: Provides details about the next three shows.

All data is returned in JSON format. While other formats are not supported at this time, we plan to introduce additional options in the future.

### Examples
```python
from flareradio import stats, upcoming

# Get current stats
try:
    data = stats()
    print(data)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Get upcoming shows
try:
    shows = upcoming()
    print(shows)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

## Testing
If you want to ensure the package is working as expected, you can run tests using `pytest`. The tests validate the functionality of both `stats()` and `upcoming()`.

To run the tests:
```bash
pytest
```
