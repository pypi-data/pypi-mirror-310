Getting started with the Cumulocity Python API
==============================================

In this article, we want to give you a step-by-step introduction to the
possibilities of the Cumulocity Python API, the ``c8y_api`` module. We will
create a simple application, read device metadata, and create and investigate
alarms.

Preliminaries
-------------
If you want to follow this guide you’d need access to a Cumulocity IoT
tenant (duh!). If you don’t have one, yet, register for your free trial `here
<https://www.softwareag.cloud/site/product/cumulocity-iot.html#>`_ and
register your mobile phone as a device following `this guide
<https://cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide/sensor-app/#overview>`_.

It's done in no time!

I also assume that you have some basic understanding of the Python
programming language, running Python applications and the Pip package
manager.

Also, the Cumulocity Python API is closely aligned to the Cumulocity REST
API. So, a fair understanding of RESTful API is definitely helpful, but not
a requirement.

A brief introduction into the Cumulocity Python API
---------------------------------------------------

The Cumulocity Python API library aims to be the standard Python library
for Cumulocity IoT application development. It is intended to be used for
standalone applications and microservices.

The API was designed with ease-of-use and performance in mind:

 - It is *pythonic*, using standard Python data types, libraries,
   conventions and idioms. Python developers will find their way in a breeze.

 - It is fully documented including all function parameters which enables
   full code completion in the programming IDE of your choice.

 - It encapsulates all Cumulocity IoT low level connectivity, takes care of
   authentication, session handling and payload parsing/formatting.

 - It automatically applies common performance optimizations like pagination,
   lazy, on demand parsing/formatting and payload minimization.

For this API we decided against creating a full Python abstraction of the
Cumulocity IoT functional, data and access model. Instead, the API is closely
aligned to the concepts of the standard `Cumulocity REST API
<https://cumulocity.com/api/core/>`_. We won’t hide the data model details,
won’t perform additional requests in the background, and alike.

So, while working with the Cumulocity Python API you will also understand how
to work with the standard REST API. You will always know exactly what’s going
on. You will always be able to perform a direct REST query for edge cases -
the API provides a set of nice access points just for that.

The Cumulocity Python API is not an official API provisioned by Software AG.
It’s an open source project (`hosted on GitHub
<https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-python-api>`_), maintained by
Software AG consultants and other Cumulocity experts world wide. You are
invited to contribute!

Getting started - project setup
-------------------------------

We want to create an application which connects to a Cumulocity IoT tenant
and lists the connected devices with owner details. The API was designed
with Docker on Cumulocity in mind, but creating a stand-alone application
is just as easy.

We will call the application/project ``firstApp`` - feel free to choose your
own catchy name and be sure to change the listings below accordingly.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ mkdir -p firstApp/src
   $ cd firstApp

Create a virtual environment and get the c8y-API library
--------------------------------------------------------

We recommend using a virtual environment by default, you can do without but
there is no reason not to. If you are new to Python and virtual environments
have a look here: `Python Virtual Environments: A Primer <https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#how-can-you-work-with-a-python-virtual-environment>`_

.. code-block:: shell

   $ python3 -m venv venv            # create virtual environment
   $ source venv/bin/activate        # step into the virtual environment
   (venv) pip3 install c8y-api       # install the Cumulocity Python API

The last command will download the latest version of the Cumulocity Python
API (the module is abbreviated ``c8y-api``) including all dependencies from
`pypi.org <http://pypi.org>`_ and install it into the previously created virtual environment
(indicated by the ``(venv)`` prompt).

Now we are all set to start developing!

Connecting to the Cumulocity tenant
-----------------------------------

We will start by creating our main Python script, e.g. ``src/app.py`` in an
code editor of your choice. For this guide we won’t need anything more
sophisticated.

Our entry point to the world of Cumulocity IoT is through the
``CumulocityApi`` class which can be imported from the ``c8y_api`` library using

.. code-block:: python

   from c8y_api import CumulocityApi

   c8y = CumulocityApi(base_url='',    # the url of your Cumulocity tenant here
                       tenant_id='',   # the tenant ID of your Cumulocity tenant here
                       username='',    # your Cumulocity IoT username
                       password='')    # your Cumulocity IoT password

The ``CumulocityApi`` class can be initialized with all necessary connection
and authentication details for your Cumulocity IoT tenant. Don’t worry! There
are more advanced, enterprise-ready methods to provide this information, but
for now this one is a lot more explicit and easier to use.

First action!
-------------

In this first application we will simply iterate through all registered
devices and list their Cumulocity object ID, designation and owner:

.. code-block:: python

   for d in c8y.device_inventory.select():
       print(f"Found device #{d.id} '{d.name}', owned by {d.owner}")

Let’s have a look at this in detail. You can see that access to the device
inventory is provided through the ``device_inventory`` property of the
``CumulocityApi`` class. Likewise, it provides access to events, alarms,
managed objects and all other aspects of the Cumulocity information model.
Feel free to explore!

Looping through objects is provided through the ``select`` function. This
function features many parameters, primarily to specify selection filters.
We don’t worry about these right now because we simply want to see
everything. Internally, this function sends a ``GET`` request to the
``/inventory/managedObjects`` endpoint, parses the result, and produces
corresponding Python objects.

The return of the ``select`` function is a series of ``Device`` instances
that you can work with directly. In this example we simply print the
Cumulocity IoT object ID, the device name and the device owner. All given
properties of a ``Device`` object in Cumulocity are represented as
corresponding class properties in Python. And - as the result of the
``select`` function is typed - code completion works as well.

This is it! Assuming that you are in the project base folder and you’ve put
your code into file ``src/app.py`` you can run your first application by

.. code-block:: shell

  (venv) python src/app.py

This outputs the metadata of all registered devices onto the console.

Creating an alarm
-----------------

Now, we will start changing things. If you already have some experience with
Cumulocity IoT you might know about its flexible information model. We will
make use of it by creating an alarm with custom fragments.

An alarm can be created by creating an ``Alarm`` object and posting it. The
``Alarm`` class can be imported from the ``c8y_api.model`` package. We also
import the standard ``datetime`` class to time the alarm properly:

.. code-block:: python

   from c8y_api.model import Alarm
   from datetime import datetime, timezone

To raise an alarm for a specific device, we need the Cumulocity IoT object ID
of one of the registered devices. Luckily, we just printed all of them in the
previous section. You might just pick one of them by updating this line:

.. code-block:: python

   device_id = '' # your device ID needs to be inserted here

You can also just pick ID of the last device listed before like this:

.. code-block:: python

   device_id = d.id  # d is still in memory from the loop

The ``Alarm`` class’ constructor features named parameters for the alarm’s
core properties like ``type`` and ``time``. Please note that we specify the
device by pushing the previously copied Cumulocity object ID into the
``source`` parameter.

.. code-block:: python

   alarm_time = datetime.now(timezone.utc)

   test_alarm = Alarm(type='cx_TestAlarm',
                      time=alarm_time,
                      source=device_id,
                      text=f"Test alarm at {alarm_time}",
                      severity=Alarm.Severity.WARNING)

   c8y.alarms.create(test_alarm)

After instantiation, the object is then inserted into Cumulocity IoT using
the ``create`` function which is one of many held at the ``alarms`` property
of the ``CumulocityApi`` instance we previously set up.

Go ahead an run our changes. you won’t see any additional output, but you
should now be able to locate the created alarm within the Cumulocity IoT web
interface.

Custom fragments
----------------

Let’s extend this scenario a bit. As previously said, Cumulocity IoT features
a very flexible information model - virtually any JSON structure can be
attached to any database object as custom fragments (see also:
`Cumulocity IoT’s domain model <https://cumulocity.com/guides/concepts/domain-model/#fragments>`_).

Likewise, we can simply provide additional properties as custom fragments
after the standard parameters in the Cumulocity Python API:

.. code-block:: python

   test_alarm = Alarm(type='cx_TestAlarm',
                      time=alarm_time,
                      source=device_id,
                      text=f"Test alarm at {alarm_time}",
                      severity=Alarm.Severity.WARNING,
                      # custom fragments below
                      cx_CustomData={'foo': 'bar', 'data': {'is_important': True}})

Here, we added a fragment named ``cx_CustomData`` with some random data in it.
As you can see, you can provide any JSON structure here.

Alternatively you can add such fragments after object instantiation using the
``[]`` operator:

.. code-block:: python

   test_alarm['cx_MoreData'] = {'nice': True}

Once these fragments are present, you can easily access them using standard Python notation:

.. code-block:: python

   test_alarm['cx_CustomData']['foo']          # access using [] notation
   test_alarm.cx_CustomData.data.is_important  # access using dot notation

Let’s loop through all alarms and list their details:

.. code-block:: python

   for a in c8y.alarms.select(source=device_id):
       print(f"Found alarm #{a.id}, {a.text}, fragments: {list(a.keys())}")
       if 'cx_CustomData' in a:
           print(f"   Important: {a.cx_CustomData.data.is_important}")
           print(f"   More data: {a['cx_CustomData']['foo']}")

Like before, when we looped through the devices, we use a ``select`` function
to loop through objects. Note that we are working with the ``alarms`` instead
of the ``device_inventory`` resource this time. The Cumulocity Python API
defines multiple of these resources that all behave in the same way.

You can see a lot of additional features of the API as well. First of all, we
introduced a filter: we only select alarms that are assigned to our device
using the ``source`` parameter for filtering. When exploring ``Alarm`` objects
we can work with fragments using standard Python notation: We use the
``keys()`` function to list custom fragments, the ``in`` operator to check for
specific fragments and the ``[]`` operator as well as *dot notation* to
address specific properties of these fragments.

You can run this application again. You will see additional output that lists
all alarms (the just created and any previous ones), including the custom
fragments.

Clearing alarms
---------------

Within Cumulocity IoT, alarms are special events that need manual
intervention. They feature a lifecycle and correspondingly can only be
created once (creating an identical alarm multiple times does not raise
the alarm again, see also `Cumulocity IoT’s Event model <https://cumulocity.com/guides/concepts/domain-model/#events>`_.

Because of this, we can run our sample application multiple times without
spamming the platform with additional alarms. A alarm can only be raised
(i.e. created) again, when it was previously acknowledged and cleared. We
can do this in the UI (feel free to do that right now!) or we can do this
using Python.

Updating via the Cumulocity Python API is particularly easy. Let ups loop
through all alarms of our device and clear them:

.. code-block:: python

   for a in c8y.alarms.select(source=device_id, status=Alarm.Status.ACTIVE):
       a.status = Alarm.Status.CLEARED
       a.update()
       print(f"Alarm #{a.id} cleared.")

Like before we use the ``select`` function to loop over the alarms. This
time, we add another filter for the alarm’s status - no need to visit
inactive alarms.

To update an alarm we simply update the status property of the instance and
invoke the ``update`` function. Internally this will create a POST request
which will push the changes (the status update) to Cumulocity IoT.

Invoking the ``update`` function directly on the Alarm instance is what we
call the **object-oriented invocation style**. In fact, if you prefer
differently you can also invoke the update function **functional style** on
the ``CumulocityApi`` instance with the same result.

.. code-block:: python

   c8y.alarms.update(a)   # this would work as well

You can now run the application over and over again. It will

 - first list all devices,
 - then create an alarm for one of them,
 - list all already created alarms
 - acknowledge all open alarms

A note to pro-users
-------------------

You might think that you could have updated our alarm directly without the
loop like this:

.. code-block:: python

   test_alarm.status = Alarm.Status.CLEARED
   test_alarm.update()   # this does not work

This won’t work. Why? Well, in the end the ``update`` function of the
``Alarm`` class needs to send a POST request towards Cumulocity IoT. To be
able to do that it needs to have access to a valid connection. We haven’t
specified that. Also, to update an object you need the Cumulocity IoT object
ID (of the alarm). We haven’t specified that either.

If you know the ID of the alarm object, you could do that, though:

.. code-block:: python

   test_alarm.c8y = c8y   # specify cumulocity connection
   test_alarm.id  = ''    # specify the alarm object id

   test_alarm.status = Alarm.Status.CLEARED
   test_alarm.update()    # this would work now

Ok, but wait! Why does the very same then work within the loop? Well, because
both - the connection reference and the object ID - are injected into the
``Alarm`` instances generated by the ``select`` function automatically.
Neat, right?

Where to next?
--------------

Hopefully you had fun following this quick start guide and you got interested
in learning more. Please feel free to experiment! We hope that we were able
to show that the Cumulocity Python API makes development for Cumulocity IoT
as easy as it can possibly be.

Some hints where to go next:

- Build your own metadata using the Cumulocity inventory. The Cumulocity
  Python API makes handling custom fragments particularly easy!

 - Have a look at measurements! You can use the API to easily grab
   measurements of a specific types, timeframes and other characteristics.
   You can also create measurements using a neat object-oriented API
