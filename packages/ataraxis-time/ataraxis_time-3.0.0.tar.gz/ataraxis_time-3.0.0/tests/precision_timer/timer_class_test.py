"""Tests the functionality of the PrecisionTimer class.

This is not a performance benchmark! This test suite only verifies that commands run without errors and that their
runtime appears to be correct. Due to the nature of this library, programmatic tests are likely to have a wide range of
execution times across all supported platform+architecture combinations. The only way to be sure the library is
appropriate for any particular system is to use the benchmarking script shipped with the library. Passing this test
suite is not sufficient to conclude the library is appropriate for any particular use case, it is only enough to
conclude it runs without errors.
