Executors
=========

This package contains the built-in executors for Chancy. Executors are
responsible for managing the execution of jobs after they've been retrieved
from a queue.

Chancy comes with two built-in executors:

- :class:`chancy.executors.process.ProcessExecutor`: This executor will execute
    jobs in a separate process. This is the default executor.
- :class:`chancy.executors.asyncex.AsyncExecutor`: This executor will execute
    asyncio jobs in the same process as the worker.
- :class:`chancy.executors.thread.ThreadedExecutor`: This executor will execute
    jobs in a separate thread.
- :class:`chancy.executors.sub.SubInterpreterExecutor`: This executor will
    execute jobs in a separate thread.

You can implement your own executor by subclassing the
:class:`chancy.executors.base.Executor` class and implementing the
:meth:`~chancy.executors.base.Executor.push` method.
