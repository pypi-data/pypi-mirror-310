## Installation
To install the library, run

```sh

pip install hydrogenpay_python

```

## Initialization

```py
from hydrogenpay_python import Hydrogenpay, HydrogenpayExceptions


# Initialize Hydrogenpay with API keys from environment variables
hydrogenpay = Hydrogenpay("YOUR SANDBOX_API_KEY", "YOUR SECRET API_KEY", 'test', setEnv=True)

# Initialize Hydrogenpay without API keys from environment variables
# hydrogenpay = Hydrogenpay(os.getenv("SANDBOX_API_KEY"), os.getenv("LIVE_API_KEY"), os.getenv("MODE"), setEnv=False)
hydrogenpay = Hydrogenpay("YOUR SANDBOX_API_KEY", "YOUR SECRETE API_KEY", 'test', setEnv=False)

# Call the PaymentService class to confirm the payment status
response = self.hydrogenpay.PaymentService.confirmpayment(txRef)

# Call the Transfer class to initiate a transfer and validate the response
response = self.hydrogenpay.Transfer.initiate(transfer_details)

# Call the PaymentService class to initiate a payment and validate the response
response = self.hydrogenpay.PaymentService.initiate(payment_details)

# Call the BankTransfer class to simulate a bank transfer
response = self.hydrogenpay.BankTransfer.simulatetransfer(transfer_details)

# Call the Card class to initiate a card payment request to the customer
response = self.hydrogenpay.Card.purchase(transaction_details, request_key)

# Call the Card class to validate the OTP when the purchase call response code is H01
response = self.hydrogenpay.Card.validateOTP(validation_data, request_key)

# Call the Card class to resend the OTP if it fails to deliver to the customer
response = self.hydrogenpay.Card.resendOTP(resend_data, request_key)

# Call the Card class to confirm the status of transactions
response = self.hydrogenpay.Card.confirmPurchaseStatus(txRef, request_key)

```

# Usage
This documentation covers all components of the hydrogen_python SDK.

## ```Payment```
This is used to facilitating the completion of payments through their preferred methods, including card or bank transfer..


*Usage*

```python

from hydrogenpay_python import Hydrogenpay, HydrogenpayExceptions
import logging #If Using Logging instead of print.


# Mock data for initiating a payment
        payment_details = {
            "amount": "50",
            "currency": "NGN",
            "email": "devtest@randomuser.com",
            "customerName": "Dev Test",
            "meta": "Test transaction",
            "callback": "https://webhook.site/43309fe4-a1f7-406d-afff-09e1cb12b9ec", #"https://example.com/callback"
            "isAPI": True
        }

        try:
            # Call the Transfer class to initiate a transfer and validate the response
            response = self.hydrogenpay.PaymentService.initiate(payment_details)
            # print(f"Payment initiation success: {response}")
            logger.info("Payment initiation successful:")
            logger.info(json.dumps(response, indent=4))


        except HydrogenpayExceptions.PaymentInitiateError as e:
            # Mark test as failed if payment initiation fails
            self.fail(f"Payment initiation failed: {e}")

```

*Arguments*

- `amount`: Amount to debit the customer.
- `currency`: Default to NGN if not passed, other currencies available are USD and GBP.
- `email`: Customer’s Email Address.
- `customerName`: Customer's name.
- `meta`: Customer's email address
- `callback`: Redirect URL after payment has been completed on the gateway.
- `isAPI`: Amount in kobo


*Returns*

Response Example:

```py
Payment initiation successful:
{
    "error": false,
    "validationRequired": true,
    "txRef": "36934683_766196b316",
    "authUrl": "https://payment.hydrogenpay.com?transactionId=94850000-d1b0-2648-175f-08dce946623e&Mode=19289182"

```


## ```Confirm Payment```

This allows businesses to verify the status of initiated payments using the transaction reference. This process utilizes the transaction reference to retrieve the specified payment's current status (e.g., success, failed, pending).

*Usage*

```python

from hydrogenpay_python import Hydrogenpay, HydrogenpayExceptions
import logging #If Using Logging instead of print.

 # Transaction reference obtained from a previous payment initiation
        txRef = "36934683_87087a9180"  # Replace with an actual reference

        try:
            # Call the SDK to confirm the payment status
            response = self.hydrogenpay.PaymentService.confirmpayment(txRef)

            logger.info("Payment confirmation successful:")
            logger.info(json.dumps(response, indent=4))


        except HydrogenpayExceptions.TransactionVerificationError as e:
            # Fail the test if transaction confirmation fails
            self.fail(f"Transaction confirmation failed: {e}")

```

*Arguments*

**Endpoint Flow Summary For Card Transaction**

- The payment flow varies based on the response code from the purchase call:

***Response Code H01 (OTP Authentication Required):***

- Directs user to an OTP page.

- User inputs the OTP they receive.

- OTP is validated via a separate call.

- Payment status is updated based on OTP validation.

***Response Code H21 (Local Cards - 3D Secure Required):***

- Redirects user to the issuing bank's 3D Secure page.

- Completes 3D Secure authentication.

- Validates the 3D Secure response from the bank.

- Updates the payment status accordingly.

***Response Code H51 (International Cards - 3D Secure with Billing Information):***

- Collects additional billing information from the user.

- Redirects user to the issuing bank's 3D Secure page.

- Completes 3D Secure authentication.

- Validates the bank's response.

- Updates the payment status based on the outcome.


## Testing

All SDK tests are implemented using Python's ```unittest``` module. They currently cover:

```hydrogenpay.PaymentService```
```hydrogenpay.ConfirmPayment```
```hydrogenpay.BankTransfer```
```hydrogenpay.Transfer```
```hydrogenpay.Card```

```sh
Running the Tests

1. Navigate to the tests directory in your terminal.

2. You can run each test file separately using the following command:

python -m unittest test_initiate_payment.py
python -m unittest test_confirm_payment.py
python -m unittest test_initiate_bank_transfer.py
python -m unittest test_simulate_bank_transfer.py

3. Optional: Run All Tests at Once

If you want to run all tests in the tests directory together, you can use the following command:

python -m unittest discover -s tests 

OR

To run specific tests by name, use the following command:

python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_card_purchase_confirm_status.py"

```
