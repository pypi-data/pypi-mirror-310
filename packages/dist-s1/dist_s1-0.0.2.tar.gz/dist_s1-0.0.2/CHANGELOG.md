## [0.0.2]

### Added

- Pypi delivery workflow
- Entrypoint for CLI to localize data via internet (the SAS workflow is assumed not to have internet access)
- Data models for output data and product naming conventions
- Ensures output products follow the product and the tif layers follow the expected naming conventions
  - Provides testing/validation of the structure (via tmp directories)

### Changed

- CLI entrypoints now utilize `dist-s1 run_sas` and `dist-s1 run` rathern than just `dist-s1`. 
  - The `dist-s1 run_sas` is the primary entrypoint for Science Application Software (SAS) for SDS operations. 
  - The `dist-s1 run` is the simplified entrypoint for external users, allowing for the localization of data from publicly available data sources.

## [0.0.1]

### Added

- Initial internal release of the DIST-S1 project. Test github release workflow
