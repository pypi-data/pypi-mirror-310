## üöÄ Problem Statement

For developers, frequent manual restarts of terminal applications during development can add up quickly, especially in complex Tkinter projects that require regular updates. `tkreload` provides a solution to this by automating the reload process, resulting in significant time savings.

### ‚è≥ Estimated Time Saved with tkreload

Imagine restarting your terminal application **15 times daily**, with each reload taking **30 seconds**. That‚Äôs approximately **7.5 minutes daily** or about **3 hours per month**. `tkreload` helps avoid this productivity drain.

## üîç Solution Overview

`tkreload` automates reloading for terminal-based Python applications, designed specifically for **Tkinter**. By eliminating the need for manual restarts, it streamlines the development process, saving developers valuable time and enhancing productivity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python** 3.9+
- **pip** for dependency management

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/iamDyeus/tkreload.git
cd tkreload
```
#### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install tkreload (in editable mode):
```sh
pip install -e.[test]
```

# Usage

To run the app with `tkreload`, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
tkreload your_app.py
```

Now, whenever you save changes to your script, tkreload will automatically reload your application.

## üåü Features

- **Automatic Reloading:** Automatically restarts Tkinter apps upon file changes.
- **Command-Based Control:**
  - **`H`:** View help commands
  - **`R`:** Restart the application
  - **`A`:** Toggle auto-reload
  - **`Ctrl + C`:** Exit the application
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Uses `rich` for styled console feedback and progress indicators.



## Testing
To verify tkreload functionality, follow these steps:

1.Install Testing Dependencies: Make sure all testing libraries are installed as per the requirements.txt file.

2.Run Tests Using Pytest
```bash
pytest -v
```
This will run the test suite and confirm tkreload is working as expected.
