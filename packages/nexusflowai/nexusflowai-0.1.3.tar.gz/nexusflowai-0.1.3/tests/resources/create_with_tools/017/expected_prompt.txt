User Query: During last night's basketball game, one of the star players was on fire, attempting a whopping 30 free throws. It's generally known that the average success rate for free throws hovers around 50%. I'm curious, with that success probability, what are the chances that the player made exactly 15 out of those 30 attempts? <human_end>
