The condition types define how the filter should be applied, and the values represent the data that the condition will be matched against. Below is an explanation of the supported condition types and the expected values for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Condition Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Comparison Conditions**:\n",
    "   - **GreaterThan**, **GreaterThanOrEqual**, **LessThan**, **LessThanOrEqual**:\n",
    "     - These conditions are used to filter records based on comparison operations.\n",
    "     - **Expected Values**: A single value (e.g., a number or date).\n",
    "     - **Example**: For `GreaterThan`, the filter could be configured as `{ \"Condition\": \"GreaterThan\", \"Values\": [50] }`, meaning that only records where the column value is greater than 50 will be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Range Conditions**:\n",
    "   - **Between**, **NotBetween**:\n",
    "     - These conditions filter records by checking if a value falls within a range.\n",
    "     - **Expected Values**: Two values, representing the start and end of the range.\n",
    "     - **Example**: `{ \"Condition\": \"Between\", \"Values\": [10, 20] }` will include records where the column value is between 10 and 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inclusion/Exclusion Conditions**:\n",
    "   - **In**, **NotIn**:\n",
    "     - These conditions check whether a value is within a specified list of values.\n",
    "     - **Expected Values**: A list of one or more values.\n",
    "     - **Example**: `{ \"Condition\": \"In\", \"Values\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"] }` includes records where the column value is \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Text Matching Conditions**:\n",
    "   - **Contains**, **StartsWith**, **EndsWith**, and their negated versions (**NotContains**, **NotStartsWith**, **NotEndsWith**):\n",
    "     - These conditions apply to text fields and filter records based on substring matching.\n",
    "     - **Expected Values**: A single string value.\n",
    "     - **Example**: `{ \"Condition\": \"Contains\", \"Values\": [\"keyword\"] }` will filter records where the column value contains the substring \"keyword\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multi-Value Text Matching Conditions**:\n",
    "   - **Conditions ending in \"And\" or \"Or\"** (e.g., **ContainsAnd**, **StartsWithOr**):\n",
    "     - These conditions allow combining multiple text-matching conditions with logical \"AND\" or \"OR\" operations.\n",
    "     - **Expected Values**: A list of two or more string values.\n",
    "     - **Example**: `{ \"Condition\": \"ContainsOr\", \"Values\": [\"keyword1\", \"keyword2\"] }` will filter records where the column value contains either \"keyword1\" or \"keyword2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filter Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Date Values**: If the column being filtered is a date field, the filter values should be provided as strings in the format `DD-MMM-YYYY`, such as `\"15-Sep-2023\"`. These values should be included in the `Values` list as `[\"15-Sep-2023\"]`.. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Example**: For a `GreaterThan` condition on a date field, the filter might look like:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"Table\": \"Orders\",\n",
    "      \"Column\": \"OrderDate\",\n",
    "      \"Condition\": \"GreaterThan\",\n",
    "      \"Values\": [\"01-Jan-2023\"]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This would filter records to include only those where the `OrderDate` is after January 1, 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numeric Values**: For numeric filters, values should be provided as integers or floats. The function will format these appropriately for the filter condition.\n",
    "  - **Example**: `{ \"Condition\": \"LessThan\", \"Values\": [100] }`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Values**: For text-based conditions, values should be strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **None Values**: If the `Values` field is set to `None`, the filter for that column will be cleared, regardless of the condition. This means that any existing filter applied to the specified column will be removed from the report. The `None` value effectively acts as a reset for the filter.\n",
    "  - **Example**: `{ \"Table\": \"Orders\", \"Column\": \"OrderDate\", \"Condition\": \"GreaterThan\", \"Values\": None }` will clear any existing filter on the `OrderDate` column.\n"

    "# Example 8: Sanitize PBIR Report\n",
    "Thes function is a powerful utility designed to clean up and optimize Power BI reports by performing various sanitization actions. It helps remove unnecessary components, improve report performance, and maintain a clean report structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### `report_path` (str): The file system path to the folder containing the PowerBI report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `actions` (list[str]):  A list of sanitization actions to perform on the report.\n",
    "- **Available Actions**:\n",
    "  1. `\"remove_unused_measures\"`: \n",
    "     - Removes measures that are not used in any visuals either directly or indirectly through measure dependencies.\n",
    "     - Helps reduce report complexity and improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. `\"remove_unused_bookmarks\"`: \n",
    "     - Removes bookmarks that are not activated through bookmark navigators or actions.\n",
    "     - Cleans up unused bookmark configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. `\"remove_unused_custom_visuals\"`: \n",
    "     - Removes custom visuals that are not used in the report.\n",
    "     - Reduces report file size and potential performance overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. `\"disable_show_items_with_no_data\"`: \n",
    "     - Disables the \"Show items with no data\" option for all visuals.\n",
    "     - Helps improve visual performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "  5. `\"hide_tooltip_drillthrough_pages\"`: \n",
    "     - Hides tooltip and drillthrough pages from the report view.\n",
    "     - Keeps the main report clean and focused.\n",
    "\n",
    "  6. `\"set_first_page_as_active\"`: \n",
    "     - Sets the first page of the report as the default active page.\n",
    "     - Ensures a consistent initial view when opening the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "  7. `\"remove_empty_pages\"`: \n",
    "     - Removes pages that do not contain any visuals.\n",
    "     - Streamlines the report structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "  8. `\"remove_hidden_visuals_never_shown\"`: \n",
    "     - Removes visuals and groups that are permanently hidden and never displayed.\n",
    "     - Reduces report complexity with rougue visuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "  9. `\"cleanup_invalid_bookmarks\"`: \n",
    "     - Removes bookmarks referencing non-existent pages or visuals.\n",
    "     - Ensures bookmark integrity and prevents potential errors.\n",
    "\n",
