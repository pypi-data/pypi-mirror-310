The docs are clear and concise, along with full Youtube tutorials that break down the simple basics. I was very new to automation and the founder, Diana, was extremely helpful. There is also an active Discord with many community members who share their expertise. I must commend Diana and her team on the speed of the updates, and the rate they answer their support requests. I never had to send an email, because either Diana or one of the members in Discord helped me pretty much immediately. I requested a feature to be added on March 02, 2024, the latest update on March 14, 2024 included my request. Since then, there are have been 4 updates that included many community members' feature requests. 4 major updates in 3 months, you really have to give the team some credit. I'm writing this review after thoroughly testing the software. I have to admit, there is a learning curve. I haven't been able to use all of the features because I don't need them, honestly. Other similar software has subscription models priced at at least double the amount of ZeroWork and half the features and/or included automation tasks. Dollar for dollar, this thing is packed with a ton of value. Users must understand that while it is a no-code software, you still have to learn how to properly utilize and tweak the software for your specific needs.\"\n\n![Image 60](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/665f461fd9a00fb1c16a9529/6665fab3775afcf3cc69c26c_07_logo_ebizhero_white_font_solid_black_background_1000x1000px_circle.jpeg)\n\nPatric Tanner\n\nPatrick Tanner, Verified Purchaser, AppSumo\n\nIf you're looking for a way to automate your web tasks without spending hours coding, then ZeroWork is the perfect solution! With this no-code tool, you can create powerful automations with just clicks and drag-and-drops. But don't be fooled - you still need to invest some time into learning if you want to take full advantage of the automation capabilities. If you're willing to put in the effort though, ZeroWork will reward you with some seriously impressive results! Plus, with a super supportive community and founder always available for advice, you'll never feel like you're alone in the process. Join their Facebook and Discord community channels - come find me @webmajor if you want to chat! I'm a CSS selector ninja and I'm ready to show off my skills. ;-)))) Stop waiting around and get ZeroWork now - with an amazing roadmap available, who knows where this journey will take us!\n\n[View ALL Reviews ![Image 61](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/665d9094e3e27b31b62b3653/665f4410c10d378164346181_Vector%2023.svg)](https://www.zerowork.io/reviews)"

Five tacos all around for this amazing tool and its fantastic creator!\"\n\n![Image 45](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/665f461fd9a00fb1c16a9529/6665f99d6d5c7618f65ba60a_avatar_neutral-1344761957.png)\n\nDerek R.\n\nDerek R., review on Trustpilot\n\n\"I purchased ZeroWork back in February 2023 through a lifetime deal, and I'm in constant awe of how much the software has grown in that time. The docs are clear and concise, along with full Youtube tutorials that break down the simple basics. I was very new to automation and the founder, Diana, was extremely helpful. There is also an active Discord with many community members who share their expertise. I must commend Diana and her team on the speed of the updates, and the rate they answer their support requests. I never had to send an email, because either Diana or one of the members in Discord helped me pretty much immediately. I requested a feature to be added on March 02, 2024, the latest update on March 14, 2024 included my request. Since then, there are have been 4 updates that included many community members' feature requests. 4 major updates in 3 months, you really have to give the team some credit. I'm writing this review after thoroughly testing the software. I have to admit, there is a learning curve. I haven't been able to use all of the features because I don't need them, honestly. Other similar software has subscription models priced at at least double the amount of ZeroWork and half the features and/or included automation tasks. Dollar for dollar, this thing is packed with a ton of value. Users must understand that while it is a no-code software, you still have to learn how to properly utilize and tweak the software for your specific needs.\"\n\n![Image 46](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/665f461fd9a00fb1c16a9529/6665fab3775afcf3cc69c26c_07_logo_ebizhero_white_font_solid_black_background_1000x1000px_circle.jpeg)\n\nPatric Tanner\n\nPatrick Tanner, Verified Purchaser, AppSumo\n\nIf you're looking for a way to automate your web tasks without spending hours coding, then ZeroWork is the perfect solution!

I was able to automate my web tasks without any problem and plan to use it more and more. The support is very responsive and the Discord community is very active. The interface is intuitive and the system of an agent installable on a computer is a real plus compared to automation products that are 100% cloud-based. This allows, among other things, not to be limited in the number of task launches.\"\n\n![Image 21](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/665f461fd9a00fb1c16a9529/6665f77c2753d8cfef6478cf_Screen_Shot_2022-08-19_at_9.56.45_AM%20(1).webp)\n\nchiefkief\n\nchiefkief, Verified Purchaser, AppSumo\n\n\"If you are willing to spend a little time going over the tutorials, this tool is one of the best purchases you will ever make.

I was able to automate a task that I used to pay a VA $350/month to do, and it now runs seamlessly in the background, saving me time and money. One of the things that sets Zerowork.io apart from other automation tools is the amazing support and community. Diana, the creator, is incredibly supportive and active in the community, always willing to help and answer questions. ZeroWork team takes user feedback seriously and is constantly working to improve the product. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, and the documentation and tutorials are top-notch. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or a complete novice, you'll find Zerowork.io easy to use and understand. Overall, I am thrilled with Zerowork.io and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to streamline their business processes and save time and money.

The docs are clear and concise, along with full Youtube tutorials that break down the simple basics. I was very new to automation and the founder, Diana, was extremely helpful. There is also an active Discord with many community members who share their expertise. I must commend Diana and her team on the speed of the updates, and the rate they answer their support requests. I never had to send an email, because either Diana or one of the members in Discord helped me pretty much immediately. I requested a feature to be added on March 02, 2024, the latest update on March 14, 2024 included my request. Since then, there are have been 4 updates that included many community members' feature requests. 4 major updates in 3 months, you really have to give the team some credit. I'm writing this review after thoroughly testing the software. I have to admit, there is a learning curve. I haven't been able to use all of the features because I don't need them, honestly. Other similar software has subscription models priced at at least double the amount of ZeroWork and half the features and/or included automation tasks. Dollar for dollar, this thing is packed with a ton of value. Users must understand that while it is a no-code software, you still have to learn how to properly utilize and tweak the software for your specific needs.\"\n\n![Image 25](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/665f461fd9a00fb1c16a9529/6665fab3775afcf3cc69c26c_07_logo_ebizhero_white_font_solid_black_background_1000x1000px_circle.jpeg)\n\nPatric Tanner\n\nPatrick Tanner, Verified Purchaser, AppSumo\n\nIf you're looking for a way to automate your web tasks without spending hours coding, then ZeroWork is the perfect solution! With this no-code tool, you can create powerful automations with just clicks and drag-and-drops. But don't be fooled - you still need to invest some time into learning if you want to take full advantage of the automation capabilities. If you're willing to put in the effort though, ZeroWork will reward you with some seriously impressive results! Plus, with a super supportive community and founder always available for advice, you'll never feel like you're alone in the process.

This thing is so well put together, everything just works (99.9% of the time). For example, when you duplicate a taskbot, its tables and variables are duplicated too = minimal setup for new bots.\n\nSome of my bots uncovered an edge case that the team hadn't yet built for. They were aware of this issue before I flagged it and a patch was rolled out asap. Remarkable.\n\nLearning CSS Selectors is a long-term challenge that you just need to suck it up and accept that it will be challenging. I hate selectors but love ZeroWork.\n\nYou can read Diana's responses \\*everywhere\\* to see how much she cares about this product.
