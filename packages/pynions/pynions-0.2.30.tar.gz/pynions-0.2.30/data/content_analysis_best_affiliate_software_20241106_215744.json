Vallaeys](blob:https://tapfiliate.com/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\n\nBefore adopting Tapfiliate: We struggled to find affiliate software that supported a closed invite-only affiliate program, Most solutions were designed for open programs. This allowed us to selectively invite high-quality affiliates and maintain control over who could promote our services. We looked for a solution that was not only powerful but also easy to use. Getting started with Tapfiliate was straightforward and hassle-free.\n\n![Image 21: Fabian Maume](blob:https://tapfiliate.com/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\n\nBefore we started using Tapfiliate, we didn\u2019t have any affiliate system in place. Building one in-house would have been expensive, especially since we couldn\u2019t predict its success. We had many technical questions to address, and Tapfiliate turned out to be an easy solution for all of them. One key challenge was to have proper tracking and attribution for conversion from affiliate partners. Tapfiliate have all the features we needed.\n\n![Image 22: Fabian](https://cdn.sites.tapfiliate.com/tapfiliate.com/2024/06/fabianpicture_tapfiliate_studycasepng.png)\n\n![Image 23: Henri Liljeroos](blob:https://tapfiliate.com/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\n\nWe went through many affiliate platforms and they were all either complicated, out-of-date or expensive. Usually all three. We\u2019ve used Tapfiliate for a while now and it\u2019s so easy to use that it almost makes me cry.\n\n![Image 24: Henri](https://cdn.sites.tapfiliate.com/tapfiliate.com/2024/06/screenshot-2024-05-29-173231.png)\n\nHenri Liljeroos\n\nHenri Liljeroos\n\n![Image 25: Vignesh TM](blob:https://tapfiliate.com/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\n\nWe aimed to launch our affiliate program and integrate it into our existing infrastructure with minimal tech intervention and were exploring which platform would best suit our needs. Tapfiliate offered all the features we needed, including a dashboard, asset management, affiliate account management, postback pixel integration, conversion reports, and deep linking\n\n![Image 26: Vignesh](https://cdn.sites.tapfiliate.com/tapfiliate.com/2024/06/guvi-1.jpeg)\n\nVignesh TM\n\nProduct Manager\n\n![Image 27: Shanu Singh](blob:https://tapfiliate.com/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\n\nBefore Tapfiliate managing multiple affiliates, along with the sales and validation reports, proved to be a major challenge. Tapfiliate made our affiliate management much easier. Now, we can easily onboard new affiliates and track their daily sales effortlessly. This has saved us a lot of time and allowed us to focus on growing our program.\n\n![Image 28: Shanu](https://cdn.sites.tapfiliate.com/tapfiliate.com/2024/06/shanu_singh_mivi.png)\n\nShanu Singh\n\nAffiliate manager\n\n![Image 29: Michael Yewdwell](blob:https://tapfiliate.com/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\n\nWe examined a ton of affiliate tracking softwares, and we just truly felt that Tapfiliate was superior to the competition: they are able to track sales far superior than anybody, with the accuracy and efficiency along with the data and analytics that they pair. Onboarding was extremely easy. Let\u2019s just say hitting the ground running pretty quickly once we signed up with Tapfiliate. If you\u2019re truly trying to track affiliate sales and the source of those sales I think Tapfiliate is phenomenal and you can scale with it over a long period of time.\n\n![Image 30: Michael](https://cdn.sites.tapfiliate.com/tapfiliate.com/2024/06/shopify-customer.png)\n\nMichael Yewdwell\n\nChief Sales Officer\n\n![Image 31: T\u00f5nis J\u00f5geva](blob:https://tapfiliate.com/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\n\nThe support is always here and systems are working well, I have not had any cases where tracking fails.

One main goal of these platforms is to help your business find the right customers promptly and efficiently. The target is to simplify the process of increasing revenue through partner marketing by providing an all-in-one platform that consolidates the necessary tools for efficiently managing, optimizing, and scaling partnership marketing campaigns.\n\nThat said, businesses can quickly discover new affiliates, build stronger relationships, and automate payments, eliminating the complex and time-consuming tasks associated with maintaining and expanding partnerships.\n\nIn addition, to lead capture forms, many solutions also offer integrations with third-party tools such as email marketing platforms or customer relationship management (CRM) systems. These integrations help businesses automate lead nurturing and follow-up activities, ensuring that leads are engaged and converted into customers as effectively as possible.\n\n**Why should your business use affiliate marketing software?**\n\nThe tools mentioned above make it much easier to carry out the day-to-day management of your affiliate marketing program. You can handle the increased leads your associates generate, communicate more efficiently with your partners, and manage all your links across different networks and campaigns.\n\nWith the right tools, almost every area of performance marketing can be tracked, making it much simpler to measure your ROI and check how well the affiliate program is doing. The best software has customizable dashboards to view data on sales, impressions, leads, and clicks.\n\n### **Business problems are easily solved with affiliate marketing software**\u00a0\n\nWith an extensive affiliate program come large amounts of valuable data. But keeping track of it, and taking full advantage of the insights it offers, can be a challenge. The best performance marketing software includes business intelligence tools to gather and analyze statistics.\n\nUsing AI and machine learning, affiliate marketing software assist in finding just the right audience for the products you\u2019re promoting\u2014and targeting them with super-relevant offers. For example, machine learning algorithms can analyze past customer data, website traffic, and other relevant data points to identify common characteristics or behaviors among people likely to convert. This data can create highly targeted audience segments more likely to convert than broader, less-targeted segments. Furthermore, advanced automation has advantages for fraud prevention, security, and compliance.\n\nThe right software enables you to create your affiliate program, which results in reduced cost and the ability to develop closer relationships with partners and be in complete control of the program.\n\nAnother challenge is finding the right partners for the scheme, whether you\u2019re a business looking for new associates or a marketer seeking companies to work with. Affiliate marketing software platforms, by providing a comprehensive set of tools and features for partner discovery, outreach, management, and optimization, aid companies in locating the right partners for their marketing programs, driving more traffic, leads, and sales to their website or online store.\n\n**Particular Industries also benefit from affiliate marketing software**\n\nThe popularity of affiliate marketing has never been higher. The industry\u2019s global value is estimated at [$14.3 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow to over $15.7 billion next year](https://influencermarketinghub.com/affiliate-marketing-report/). Partner marketing is used across most industries, with the retail sector contributing 43% of total market revenue.\n\nVarious business industries have benefited from using affiliate marketing software on a global scale. Affiliate marketing has been particularly beneficial for e-commerce businesses. Thanks to their unique referral links, eCommerce companies offer associates a commission on sales. Providing partners with a commission on sales generated motivates them to promote the company\u2019s products, which in turn can boost sales for the eCommerce business.\n\nAnother industry that has seen a lot of success with affiliate marketing is travel. By promoting hotels, resorts, airlines, and other travel-related businesses, travel bloggers and influencers can earn a commission on bookings made through referral links.\n\nFurthermore, the health and wellness industry has benefited from affiliate marketing. Bloggers and influencers can promote health supplements, fitness products, and other wellness-related products and earn a commission.\n\nThe finance industry has also used affiliate marketing and achieved a fantastic effect. Credit card companies can now offer customers a commission for every new credit card application approved through their referral link.\n\nLast but not least is the gaming industry: Gaming companies have found immense success with affiliate marketing usage. Partner collaborators can promote new games or gaming consoles and earn commissions on sales generated through their referral links.\n\nTo sum up, with so many diverse industries benefiting so much from affiliate marketing, it is more than evident that affiliate marketing software platforms are aiding in driving revenue and keeping tabs on all the critical information.\n\n**ROI for Affiliate Marketing**\n\nMeasuring the ROI for any type of marketing can be tricky, especially when multiple channels and data streams are needed. However, because affiliate marketing is entirely performance-based, it\u2019s fully trackable, measurable, and transparent with the right tools.\n\nTracking the ROI with affiliate marketing software gets simplified in several ways:\n\n*   **Automated tracking** of all sales, leads, clicks, and other metrics, eliminating the need for manual monitoring and reducing the risk of errors and discrepancies in the data;\n*   **Real-time reporting** on key performance metrics, such as clicks, conversions, revenue, and commissions, allows businesses to make data-driven decisions to optimize their ROI;\n*   The **commission management process** is automated, making it easier for businesses to calculate and pay out commissions to their associates, saving time and reducing the risk of errors in commission calculations;\n*   **Advanced analytics and insights** into the performance of the campaigns help businesses identify the most influential affiliates and marketing channels and make data-driven decisions that optimize their ROI.\n\nIn summary, using affiliate marketing software to measure ROI saves time, provides more accurate results, and showcases valuable insights.\n\n![Image 3: affiliate performance](https://affise.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/affiliate-performance.jpg)\n\nSource (shopify.co.uk)\n\n**How to choose the proper affiliate marketing software?**\n\nChoosing comprehensive affiliate management software with multiple features and functions is a good idea for creating and managing your marketing campaigns in one place. So, before you make a choice, be sure that the essential features for affiliate marketing are present in the solution you opt for.\n\nFirst and foremost, the platform must have extensive and customizable tracking and reporting board. Its main goal is to provide your business with customizable tracking and reporting options. This allows you to track and analyze key performance metrics in real-time and can help optimize your campaigns for maximum ROI.\n\nMulti-channel tracking is another core feature that every excellent affiliate marketing software possesses. A great platform should allow your company to track affiliate-generated sales and leads across multiple web, mobile, and social media channels. These tools can help your business expand its reach and increase sales by gaining new audiences.\n\nQuality affiliate marketing platforms should be able to automate the commission management process and make it easier for businesses to calculate and pay out commissions to their associates. This feature will save your firm ample time and reduce the risk of errors in commission calculations.\n\nFraudulent activities are becoming a staple and a grave concern with regard to affiliate marketing. Good affiliate marketing software should keep your business safe by preventing fraud, using detection tools, and implementing anti-fraud measures like IP blocking, CAPTCHA, etc. Protecting your business\u2019 resources and brand reputation ensures you only pay commissions for legitimate sales and leads.\n\nAn affiliate marketing platform should also be able to integrate with other marketing tools, such as Customer Relationship Management tools (CRM) and analytics tools, among others, and allow your business to streamline its marketing operations and improve overall performance.\n\nTo summarize, the top four features to look out for when choosing an affiliate platform should be:\n\n*   Practical tools for managing and running your affiliate program;\n*   Rich analytics for data-driven decision-making;\n*   Optimization of campaigns;\n*   Space for customization.\n\n**What is the best affiliate marketing software on the market?**\n\nChoosing the right software platform depends on how you want to set up and manage your affiliate marketing program.

      "content": "When it comes to affiliate marketing platforms, businesses have the option to choose from two distinct types: network platforms and software platforms.\n\n**Network platforms** connect affiliate marketers with brands via a network to allow them to find one another with ease. They act as the middleman between the two.\n\n**Software platforms** differ in that they provide tools and resources for affiliates and brands to manage their own affiliate program.\n\nAffiliate marketing programs assist businesses with reaching more people, driving more leads, and boosting sales. They optimize their spending through well-designed platforms, eliminating the need to enlist the help of expensive marketing companies.\n\n> _\u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate win-win situation. All affiliates get something from the arrangement, as does the company running the affiliate program, making it a mutually beneficial relationship.\u201d\u2014 Russell Brunson, Co-Founder of ClickFunnels_\n\n**[Sign up now](https://signup.tapfiliate.com/?_gl=1*vft4yf*_ga*MzE2NjAwNDY2LjE3MTQ0NzU2OTQ.*_ga_5V7JL043LJ*MTcxNDY3MjQwOC42LjEuMTcxNDY3MjYwNC41OS4wLjA.) to reach your full affiliate marketing potential!**\n\n**Types of Affiliate Marketing Platforms**\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe two main types of [affiliate marketing platforms](https://tapfiliate.com/alternatives) provide different services for different needs.\n\n**Affiliate Marketing Software**\n\nAffiliate marketing software offers a unified platform, allowing users to freely manage their affiliate program the way that works best for them.\n\nKey features typically offered by affiliate software include:\n\n*   **Tracking technology:** Affiliate software tracks the performance of affiliates, such as clicks, conversions, and sales. This data helps businesses understand the effectiveness of their affiliate marketing efforts.\n\n*   **Payment processing:** With affiliate software, users can automate the process of paying commissions to affiliates. It calculates commissions based on predefined rules and processes payments efficiently.\n*   **Performance reporting:** Affiliate software provides detailed performance reports, allowing businesses to analyze the success of their affiliate marketing campaigns. Reports may include metrics like traffic sources, conversion rates, and revenue generated.\n\nSome leading examples of affiliate software platforms include:\n\n*   **Tapfiliate:** Tapfiliate is an affiliate, referral and influencer tracking software suitable for small businesses and enterprise clients. With a straightforward user interface, and easy customization it\u2019s a great option.\n\n*   **Scaleo:** Scaleo focuses on online businesses, digital marketers, affiliate networks, and media agencies, assisting with real-time tracking, analytics, and anti-fraud solutions\n*   **Refersion:** Refersion assists various B2B and B2C businesses with tracking the performance of their partners, salespeople, and customer referrals.\u00a0\n*   **Affise:** Affise provides a software focused on B2B businesses, specifically within the SaaS, Fintech, and eCommerce industries.\n*   **LeadDyno:** LeadDyno assists businesses with the expansion of their earnings by enhancing customer relationship monitoring and sales performance.\n\n**Affiliate Marketing Networks**\n\nAffiliate networks are platforms that connect brands and merchants, acting as intermediaries between the two, like a dedicated affiliate manager. Unlike affiliate software, affiliate networks handle the entire process of affiliate marketing from recruitments, relationship management, conversion tracking and payment processing. They are excellent for merchants looking for exposure.\n\nThe key features of affiliate networks include:\n\n*   **Wide range of affiliates:** Affiliate networks have a wide range of affiliates across various industries. This wide selection allows brands to find affiliates that align with their niche, audience, and marketing strategy.\n*   **Simplified partnership process:** By acting as intermediaries, affiliate networks simplify the process of finding suitable partnerships for both merchants and affiliates. Instead of individually reaching out to potential partners, brands can browse and connect with affiliates.\n*   **Brand and affiliate support:** Many affiliate networks offer support to assist brands and affiliates in their marketing efforts. This may include providing opportunities to brands with affiliates, connecting high performing affiliates to brands, resources, training materials, and personalized guidance to help brands and affiliates optimize their campaigns and drive more conversions.\n\nExamples of affiliate partner networks include:\n\n*   **Amazon Associates:** As one of the largest and most popular affiliate networks, Amazon Associates is known for its wide range of products and high conversion rates.\n*   **ShareASale:** Known for its user-friendly interface and reliable network ShareASale enables affiliates to participate in pay-per-click and pay-per-lead programs in addition to traditional commission-based programs.\n*   **Rakuten Marketing:** Rakuten Marketing, formerly known as LinkShare, is a global affiliate network that stands out for its international reach, also offering personalized support and training.\n*   Awin: Awin is a leading affiliate network that specializes in facilitating partnerships between influencers and brands. It also offers advanced tracking and reporting capabilities, allowing affiliates to monitor their performance in real-time.\n\n**What to Think About When Choosing a Network vs a Software**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBoth affiliate network software and affiliate marketing software can play a vital role in the success of an affiliate marketing program. Both platforms offer an array of benefits for both affiliates and merchants.\n\n### Ease of Use\n\nUser-friendliness is a major deciding factor for both merchants and affiliates to determine which platform they choose.\n\nFrom the affiliate\u2019s perspective, affiliate network programs tend to be more user-friendly as they provide a centralized platform to find and join multiple affiliate programs. Affiliates can use this network to easily browse through different programs, track their performance, and receive payments from one place, making it convenient and efficient for them to manage their partnerships.\n\nOn the other hand, affiliate software platforms are more tailored toward merchants or brands looking to manage their own affiliate programs. They may not provide the same level of variety and flexibility for affiliates to choose from. Using software platforms, affiliates would need to individually join different programs on various platforms, which can be time-consuming and less convenient compared to using an affiliate network.\n\nFrom the merchant\u2019s perspective, affiliate software platforms are more user-friendly as they provide complete control and customization over their affiliate program. Merchants can easily set up, track, and manage their program, as well as communicate with their affiliates, all within one platform. This level of control and customization may not be available on affiliate networks, where merchants have to adhere to the network\u2019s rules and regulations.\n\n### Cost\n\nCost structures associated with affiliate networks and software platforms vary depending on the specific platform and the services they offer. Both affiliate networks and affiliate software platforms will typically charge initial fees and monthly fees.\n\nAffiliate networks will oftentimes charge a fee to join the network, and thereafter a monthly fee. Depending on the platform, they may also charge commission rates on sales generated through their network. As with any service, it will depend on the network what percentage they charge. This could vary, however, as some affiliate networks charge a flat fee.\n\nDepending on the complexity of your program, fees for the initial setup of your affiliate marketing software will vary. Onboarding your brand into their platform will involve a setup fee, as well as monthly maintenance fees for using the platform. The cost will also vary depending on the features used. A commission fee will typically be charged by the software platform \u2013 these charges, again, will depend on the software chosen.\n\n### Control and Customization\n\nThere are different levels of control in affiliate marketing software vs affiliate marketing networks.\n\nThe software allows users to have full control over their recruits, marketing strategy and more as, overall, the affiliate program is managed by the user. With software, users also have the option of customizing their look and feel to match their brand. Reporting and data are also completely customizable.\n\nWith affiliate marketing networks, users have limited control over aspects such as program guidelines, commission structures, and payment terms. This is because these are determined by the networks themselves. Typically, within networks, reporting and data are pre-formatted and cannot be altered.\n\n### Support and Community\n\nEach option provides a different level of support for users.\n\nAffiliate marketing networks provide a wealth of support, from access to account managers, training resources, and guidelines. The focus of these networks is connecting merchants and affiliates. Thus, the need to foster a community presence is not a priority. Many networks, however, will provide optional community forums that the user could access.\n\nAffiliate marketing software will provide varying levels of support depending on the platform. Some may offer customer support that deals with the affiliate program specifically, while others will provide dedicated tutorials instead of human-interaction. User communities may be available on some software platforms.\n\n![Image 1: Customer support chat screen](blob:https://tapfiliate.com/9d3047ea3bbc2bccbb5fc969b6d4889d)\n\n### Integration and Scalability\n\nTypically, affiliate marketing networks offer plugins or APIs for platforms and marketing tools, making integration simple. The scalability for networks is limited to their customization abilities (of which, they may not be many). Expanding beyond functionalities may require additional integrations.\n\nAffiliate marketing software integration can vary according to the complexity of your requirements. Integration is often simpler with popular platforms, but it may take longer to integrate if custom development is required. Scalability for software is high, where users are to customize features, integrations, strategies, reporting and more.\n\n### Reach and Recruitment\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that affiliate marketing networks afford a more extensive reach. You\u2019ll have access to a wide range of affiliates who are ready to be connected with merchants in your niche. Networks also often have built-in recruitment tools, listings, and search functionalities, making it very easy for affiliates to find you.\n\nSoftware will afford users a more targeted reach through platforms like email marketing and social media. Software users may need to actively recruit through various channels separate from the affiliate marketing software.\n\n![Image 2: Screenshot of integrations for a referral program inviting customers to refer others.](blob:https://tapfiliate.com/1f3380225f7dc11988802c2cc7d91c2d)\n\n_Examples of integrations for referral programs_\n\n**Which Platform is Best for Affiliate Marketing?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe best platform will depend on your specific business requirements, complexities, goals, and resources. As you can see, each of these platforms offers different advantages and disadvantages.\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting out and have limited marketing resources, an affiliate marketing network will offer a quick and simple way to [launch your affiliate program](https://tapfiliate.com/blog/wix-affiliate-program/). This is especially true if your focus is on brand awareness.\n\nFor businesses with specific niche targeting and a long-term growth plan, an affiliate marketing software is the way to go. The high scalability of software allows you to adapt your program as you grow and add features or functionalities specific to your needs.\n\nFor those looking to benefit from both, you\u2019re in luck! Combining affiliate marketing networks and software can be a powerful strategy for best results and it\u2019s completely achievable for any business.\n\n### Enter Tapfiliate\n\nTapfiliate is an affiliate marketing software that helps businesses manage their affiliate programs.
