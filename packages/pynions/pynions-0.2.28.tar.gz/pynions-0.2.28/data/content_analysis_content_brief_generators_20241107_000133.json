      "content": "What Is a content brief?\n------------------------\n\nA content brief is a document that defines the tone, the basic structure, and any specific requirements that you have for your content before you (or your writer) start writing.\n\nThey're an invaluable tool that help you define expectations for a content piece. A detailed content brief takes time to create but will lead to significant time and quality gains during the content creation process. A good content brief will make executing your content strategy easier and more efficient.\n\nDo you remember that one time where you ordered a piece of content and what was delivered did not match your expectations at all? You probably did not provide enough information to your writer to make the content fit your needs.\n\nHow can you prevent that kind of thing from happening again?\n\n**By providing a great content brief.**\n\nWhat should your content brief include?\n---------------------------------------\n\nA good content brief should include as many of the criteria that matter to you as possible. This way you can avoid unnecessary back-and-forth with your freelance writer and set expectations from the start. At a high level, it should at the very least cover your brand guidelines, a content outline and your SEO requirements.\n\nIf your content brief is well written and exhaustive, your vision for the content will be cristal clear to your writer.\n\nWe already mentioned that you need to include brand, outline and SEO. But that's a bit broad so let's break it down into concrete chunks. At Dashword we recommend covering all of these in your brief:\n\n*   Target audience\n*   Tone of voice and company description\n*   High quality content outline\n*   Keyword suggestions\n*   Examples of content you like\n*   The required content length\n\n### 1\\. Target audience\n\n![Image 1: Target audience](https://www.dashword.com/img/tools/content-brief-generator/target-audience.png)\n\nYour target audience is the group of readers you're trying to reach with your content. They can be defined by things like age, geographic location, interests, psychographics and so on. Be specific about who your target audience is. If you're too broad, you might as well not have one at all.\n\nKnow who your target audience is before you start writing content. Your content can't meet the needs of your audience if you don't know who they are. Your writer will be able to come up with a much more focused message if the target audience is clearly defined.\n\n### 2\\. Tone of voice and company description\n\n![Image 2: Tone of voice](https://www.dashword.com/img/tools/content-brief-generator/tone-of-voice.jpg)\n\nGive your writer enough information for them to understand your company and what you do. This might be less important if you've worked with your writer before. But if he's brand new to your company, this step is crucial.\n\nYour tone of voice is equally important. Even a great writer needs to understand your company and the business you're in, in order to deliver his best work.\n\nIf your writer doesn't understand your tone of voice, you might end up with content that doesn't fit your website and feels out of place.\n\n### 3\\. High quality content outline\n\n![Image 3: High quality outline](https://www.dashword.com/img/tools/content-brief-generator/chefs-kiss.png)\n\nA content outline defines the structure of your content. It's a list of all the different topics you're going to cover in your content. The outline doesn't need to be exhaustive, but it's a good idea to include at least what you consider as absolutely required.\n\nWith a good content outline you can communicate what angle your taking with your content. If you have something very specific in mind, you should come up with a title and (meta) description yourself, instead of outsourcing that to the writer.\n\nIt makes life easier for your writer too. He'll still need to research the subject you want to cover, but the research will be much more focused and faster with a good outline.\n\n### 4\\. Keyword suggestions\n\nFor search engines to consider your content relevant to the keyword you're targeting, it needs to cover your subject in depth. We're no longer in 2006 where you can just repeat your target keyword a few times and call it a day.\n\nWe're assuming that you or your content strategist already put in the necessary work to come up with the subject of this content/blog post that you're writing. The next step is to define the keywords that are relevant to your content and should absolutely be included.\n\nYou can easily do this keyword research with a content optimization tool like Dashword. To find such keywords, Dashword analyzes the top 30 Google results to determine what keywords are relevant for a given subject. What used to be several hours of manual research can be done by Dashword in a matter of minutes.\n\n### 5\\. Examples of content you like\n\nInclude in your brief examples of content that you like. This doesn't need to be content on the same subject or from your competitors (though it can be). What's important is that you find these examples well presented and engaging.\n\nIf there's things you absolutely don't like, you can include that as well.\n\n### 6\\. The required content length\n\nMore content doesn't always mean better or higher ranking content. Google wants your articles to be relevant, not just long. If your audience is looking for a short answer they'll be intimidated by a 4000 words article. They'll hit the back button in no time and Google will consider your content less relevant.\n\nThe same is true if your content is too short to properly cover a subject.\n\nWe recommend doing the necessary research on what a good content length is for your subject. Consider your outline. If your outline has 10 headings, you probably need more than 800 words to cover your subject.\n\nLeaving this up to the content writer will often lead to a content length that isn't necessarily ideal for your content, but ideal for your writer and his schedule.\n\nIf you're not sure about the length, you can always launch a Dashword report. It will tell you based on what's already ranking, for which word count you should be aiming.\n\nContent brief examples\n----------------------\n\nWe've covered the theory but you're probably interested in seeing what a content brief looks like.\n\nInstead of creating a fake one that wouldn't be very useful, we thought it would be interesting to share a real one that has actually been used.\n\nThis content brief was created by one of our customers before we had an automated brief builder.\n\nThe template is from a content writing service. Content writing services typically have entire teams of content writers whose full time job is coming up with good content. They want to avoid unnecessary back and forth with their customers so a good content brief (and template) litereally saves them time and money.\n\nYou'll see a lot of the elements that we covered in this article come back.\n\n![Image 4: Content brief example](https://www.dashword.com/img/tools/content-brief-generator/content-brief-example.png)\n\nOur free content brief template\n-------------------------------\n\nThe easiest way to build a high quality content brief is using Dashword. The second easiest way, is using our free content brief template that is based on our brief builder.

Our AI-driven content brief generator is designed to help you outline the perfect article quickly, effortlessly and at scale.\n\nOutline and research content which will rank above your competitors in minutes, not hours.\n\n ![Image 2: brief illustration (1)](https://www.keywordinsights.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/brief-illustration-1-1.png)\n\nOutline and research great content, quickly.\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThrow together the perfect content outline in minutes. We show you what ranks and we make it easy for you to improve on it.\n\n*   We scrape the top 20 ranking pages and parse the ranking pages content for your keyword.\n*   We extract all the important information from these pages and feed them to our sorting engine. We also scrape data from Reddit, Quora and People Also Asked boxes.\n*   All the data is displayed in an easy to use brief creation interface. Quickly scan and drag interesting headings and questions to the content brief generator at the click of a button. Use our AI writer to help you modify or summerize paragraphs making it easier and quicker for your writer to expand on.\n\n ![Image 3: brief illustration (1)](https://www.keywordinsights.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/brief-illustration-1-1.png)\n\nDrag and drop builder.\n----------------------\n\nWe analyse the top 20 results of a given keyword and show you all their titles, headers and summarisations of their content. We also pull in any related forum questions and use AI to generate additional questions your readers may have.\n\nQuickly scan through and \u201cflick\u201d across any headings and questions you deem relevant to outline a piece of content that'll be more comprehensive and cover more topics than all the other pieces combined. It\u2019s like a pick-n\u2019 mix.\n\nWithin 10 minutes, you\u2019ll have a content brief outlining an article that is objectively better than your competitors.\n\nPowerful AI\n-----------\n\nWe use AI to summarise all the content under important headings into bullet points. It means your writer (or you if you\u2019re writing) has existing content to work with, ensuring \"writer's block\" will never be an issue. It also significantly reduces the time needed for research.\n\nIf you've created your own headings, you can press a little button to generate powerful and accurate AI-written paragraphs.\n\nOh, and we also use AI to help you with the most boring part of any piece of content; the metadata.\n\n ![Image 4: brief illustration (3)](https://www.keywordinsights.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/brief-illustration-3.png)\n\n ![Image 5: brief illustration (4)](https://www.keywordinsights.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/brief-illustration-4.png)\n\nAnswer questions that your competitors aren't.\n----------------------------------------------\n\nTo ensure you're answering questions your competitors are missing, we pull in related PAA, Quora and Reddit Questions and use our \"Title AI\" feature to generate additional unique queries.\n\nYour content brief will be so hot.\n\nSmart filtering to remove noise\n-------------------------------\n\nOther content brief generator alternatives will often consider every ranking page, even transactional or irrelevant pages.\n\nOur Machine learning-based intent classification allows you to easily filter out these types of pages so the data is more accurate and based on long-form articles.\n\n ![Image 6: brief illustration (5)](https://www.keywordinsights.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/brief-illustration-5.png)\n\n ![Image 7: brief illustration (1)](https://www.keywordinsights.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/brief-illustration-1-1.png)\n\nExport into Word or Google Docs\n-------------------------------\n\nOnce your brief or content outline is complete, you can download it onto Word or open it straight into Google Docs.\n\nIf you don\u2019t use either, you can copy it to your clipboard (and pop it into Notion/Trello or whatever you use).\n\nWe use AI to\u00a0_help_\u00a0you speed up the content generation process but we don't allow you to write whole content pieces using it. We've done this on purpose.\n\nAI-written content is useful and accurate for short paragraphs, like product descriptions or metadata.\n\nWhen it comes to producing long-form articles, we don\u2019t think AI-written content is good enough and we'd recommend against leaning completely on AI-driven content generation. There are several reasons we believe this:\n\n*   Google recently announced that content generated using AI writing tools to manipulate Google search is against Google\u2019s Webmaster Guidelines.\n*   Google\u2019s recently launched a helpful content algorithm update which we believe is designed to target low quality AI written content.\n*   We don\u2019t believe an AI writer can write insightful and useful content than a real content writer with niche expertise.\n*   We think rehasing the content written by others is not useful. Our system allows you to see gaps in others content.\n*   The effectiveness of AI written content may be better in the short term, but when they are discovered over time, you may lose everything.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you just have an AI writer?\n-------------------------------------\n\n ![Image 8: brief illustration (6)](https://www.keywordinsights.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/brief-illustration-6.png)\n\nExplore our workflow\n--------------------\n\n###### Great content writing starts with excellent planning, and planning can be tedious.

More languages are coming soon.\n\nHow long does it take to run a report?\n\nGetting a report can take anywhere from 20 seconds to 3 minutes.

You can suggest any range you would like here. For instance, you can select a range between 1,000 - 1,500 words.\n\nThe length depends on the content type you are producing - short-form content or more in-depth articles.\n\n ![Image 33: close popup button](https://bnevol.com/resource/ai-content-brief-generator) \u00d7\n\n ![Image 34: close popup button](https://bnevol.com/resource/ai-content-brief-generator) \u00d7\n\n![Image 35: cookie](https://bnevol.com/images/asset-bank/robot-avatar-001.svg)\n\n#### **Content Direction**\n\nDirection should start high level. Explain the article's basic premise, what you want to achieve, etc.\n\nYou might also consider using instructions (prompts) such as...\n\n*   **Include** data throughout the article to support the narrative points and increase persuasiveness.\n*   **Add** bullet points where it can help the reader easily digest key points.\n*   **Do not** use the terms \"...\"\n\n\\*Keep in mind this\u00a0_**Content Direction**_ section is intended for general high-level guidance - You will have the opportunity to provide more specific subheadline content direction (if you choose) in the _**Content Structure**_ section next.\n\n ![Image 36: close popup button](https://bnevol.com/resource/ai-content-brief-generator) \u00d7\n\n ![Image 37: close popup button](https://bnevol.com/resource/ai-content-brief-generator) \u00d7\n\n![Image 38: cookie](https://bnevol.com/images/asset-bank/robot-avatar-001.svg)\n\n### Helpful Tips :)\n\n#### **Content Structure**\n\nYou may add up to 10 subheadlines with content direction for each. Providing the subheadline direction is highly recommended if you are a SME on the topic and want your perspective and voice represented in the draft.\n\n ![Image 39: close popup button](https://bnevol.com/resource/ai-content-brief-generator) \u00d7\n\n ![Image 40: close popup button](https://bnevol.com/resource/ai-content-brief-generator) \u00d7\n\n![Image 41: cookie](https://bnevol.com/images/asset-bank/robot-avatar-001.svg)\n\n#### **Subheadline Topics**\n\nWith subheadlines, you can break the body of your content into main focus areas for the reader. For instance, let's say we were writing a blog about cooking West African Jollof rice; you might suggest the first subheadline topic be...\n\n**\"gathering the ingredients\"**\n\nSubsequent subheadline topics would then follow, such as\n\n**\"Preparing the ingredients\"  \n\"Cooking instructions\"  \n\"Serving tips\"**\n\nAll are excellent subheadline topics.\n\n ![Image 42: close popup button](https://bnevol.com/resource/ai-content-brief-generator) \u00d7\n\n ![Image 43: close popup button](https://bnevol.com/resource/ai-content-brief-generator) \u00d7\n\n![Image 44: cookie](https://bnevol.com/images/asset-bank/robot-avatar-001.svg)\n\n### Helpful Tips :)\n\n#### **Providing Subheadline Input?**\n\nIn addition to providing the subheadline topic, you can also give direction for this section of content. If you opt out, the AI agent will do its best to provide content here. If you or your organization has expertise on the sub-topic, **you are highly encouraged to provide your input and perspective.**\n\n ![Image 45: close popup button](https://bnevol.com/resource/ai-content-brief-generator) \u00d7\n\n ![Image 46: close popup button](https://bnevol.com/resource/ai-content-brief-generator) \u00d7\n\n![Image 47: cookie](https://bnevol.com/images/asset-bank/robot-avatar-001.svg)\n\n#### **Providing Subheadline Direction**\n\nIt's a great choice to provide direction on the subheadline topic. Here is where your voice shines. Provide your input on the sub-topic to guide the draft. You can be as granular as you like. For instance...\n\n**If you're providing instructions for gathering ingredients for West African Jollof rice, you might explain why you prefer vegetable broth to cook the rice instead of water.**\n\n**When cooking the rice, you might explain why briefly frying the rice in oil before adding the broth will help reduce the stickiness of the rice.**\n\n\\*Remember to keep your guidance focused on the single subheadline. As you move to the subsequent subheadlines, you can provide specific directions for each.\n\n ![Image 48: close popup button](https://bnevol.com/resource/ai-content-brief-generator) \u00d7\n\n ![Image 49: close popup button](https://bnevol.com/resource/ai-content-brief-generator) \u00d7\n\n![Image 50: cookie](https://bnevol.com/images/asset-bank/robot-avatar-001.svg)\n\n### Helpful Tips :)\n\n#### **Conclusion Input**\n\nAdding direction for the conclusion ensures the reader ends with the right takeaways and impressions you intend.\n\n ![Image 51: close popup button](https://bnevol.com/resource/ai-content-brief-generator) \u00d7\n\n ![Image 52: close popup button](https://bnevol.com/resource/ai-content-brief-generator) \u00d7\n\n![Image 53: cookie](https://bnevol.com/images/asset-bank/robot-avatar-001.svg)\n\n### Helpful Tips :)\n\n#### **Conclusion Direction**\n\nKudos for providing closing direction. Closing direction can be quite simple.
