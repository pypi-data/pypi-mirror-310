Of course, this won't increase the cost for you.\n\nIn recent years, [MailerLite](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/mailerlite/) has become the go-to email marketing service for businesses looking to get their email marketing efforts up and running while sticking to a tight budget.\n\nIn fact, MailerLite is a tool we\u2019ve repeatedly awarded for its **ease of use, value for money, and excellent deliverability rates**. And if you think as highly of the tool as we do, you may feel as though MailerLite is hard to beat.\n\nDespite this, we can\u2019t deny that it **still lacks some advanced features found in other email marketing services** \u2013 often at a similar cost.\n\nWith this in mind, let\u2019s delve deeper into top-notch MailerLite alternatives that might be better matched to your specific needs. Whether you're an email marketing novice or a seasoned pro, understanding what\u2019s out there can help you make a more informed choice.\n\n*   [MailerLite\u2019s Biggest Drawbacks](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/mailerlite-alternatives/#MailerLites_Biggest_Drawbacks \"MailerLite\u2019s Biggest Drawbacks\")\n*   [11 MailerLite Alternatives](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/mailerlite-alternatives/#11_MailerLite_Alternatives \"11 MailerLite Alternatives\")\n    *   [1\\.

Even with its [competitive pricing](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/mailerlite/pricing/) (which starts at $15/month for 500 contacts on the Growing Business plan), MailerLite users miss out on several premium features. The absence of full reporting, CRM capabilities, and spam/design testing can sometimes leave more advanced marketers wanting more.\n\n**Rigorous Approval Process:**\n\nHigh deliverability rates are a must in email marketing, and MailerLite\u2019s stringent approval process no doubt contributes to its [strong performance in deliverability](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/email-deliverability-test/). However, the approval period (which can take up to 24 hours) might come off as excessive to those eager to jump in and get started.\n\n**Template Limitations:**\n\nIf you're using the [free](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/free-email-marketing-services/) version of MailerLite, be prepared to craft your emails from scratch. Access to newsletter and landing page templates is exclusive to paid users. And if you're keen on using the HTML editor, you'll need to be on the pricier Advanced plan, which starts at $20/month for 500 subscribers.\n\n**Subscriber Management:**\n\nMailerLite keeps it basic. While it does cover essential ground, the platform doesn't offer advanced subscriber management tools, with limited options for creating segments based on behavior. It also lacks an extensive [tagging](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/email-tagging/) system to help businesses categorize subscribers more flexibly, using a more rigid \u201cGroups\u201d structure instead.\n\n**Automation Gaps:**\n\nThe beauty of email marketing lies in automation, and while MailerLite does offer automated workflows for standard triggers, it stops short of more advanced ones. For instance, the inability to set automations based on page visits can be a major shortcoming for users who are serious about implementing a [marketing automation strategy](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/marketing-automation-strategy/).\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the MailerLite alternatives that could better serve your needs.  \n[![Image 1: best esp comparison template](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-esp-comparison-template.png)](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/free-newsletter-service-comparison-template/?utm_campaign=comparison-spreadsheet&utm_medium=ett-website&utm_source=lead-magnet-mailerlite-alternatives)\n\n1.

Brevo![Image 2: brevo homepage](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/brevo-homepage-e1691156638701.png)\n\nWhile MailerLite does email campaigns really well, [Brevo (formerly Sendinblue)](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/brevo/) turns it up a notch. With a slick automation workflow designer, Brevo lets you craft campaigns triggered not just by opens and clicks, but even by visits to your website. What\u2019s more, it also allows you to send [transactional emails](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/transactional-email-examples/) such as password resets, purchase confirmations, and more. With MailerLite, you need an add-on service (MailerSend) for this.\n\nBrevo also offers advanced features such as SMS and WhatsApp campaigns. And for those on the higher-tier Business plan? A/B testing, landing pages, Facebook ads, and more are all in the mix.\n\nPricing is where things really get interesting. While MailerLite charges based on your subscriber count, Brevo takes a different route, charging primarily per email instead (with generous limits for list sizes). This can save you money if your list is relatively large but you don't email them very frequently. And if you only send the occasional newsletter, Brevo offers a useful pay-as-you-go option.\n\n#### Brevo video review:\n\n![Image 3: brevo video review](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/video-banner-40995-1.jpg)\n\n#### Where Brevo beats MailerLite:\n\nBrevo\u2019s free plan generally gives you more than MailerLite. For example, you won\u2019t have access to newsletter or landing page templates on MailerLite\u2019s free plan, which is a pretty big limitation.\n\nIf you need advanced features like SMS marketing, live chat, or sales CRM functionalities, MailerLite doesn't provide these capabilities like Brevo does. It also requires you to subscribe to its separate MailerSend service for transactional emails.\n\nPrice-wise, we find Brevo to be more competitive, especially if you\u2019re working with larger lists. Brevo\u2019s prices start at $9/month. You can compare Brevo and MailerLite\u2019s costs using our [email marketing cost calculator](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/email-marketing-cost/).\n\n#### Where MailerLite wins:\n\nAmong all the email marketing software we've evaluated, MailerLite stands out for its exceptional email deliverability. Recently, Brevo's deliverability performance has seen a decline, which is obviously not ideal if you\u2019re sending regular campaigns.\n\nAnother big difference is that MailerLite users can sell digital products, including subscriptions, directly from the platform. This is a feature that Brevo currently doesn't offer.\n\n#### When we\u2019d recommend Brevo:\n\nWhen stacked up against MailerLite, Brevo shines for those with a hefty contact list but who aren't hitting \u201cSend\u201d all that often. If you're on the hunt for a tool that offers great bang for your buck, with perks like CRM, SMS, and live chat, then Brevo is definitely worth a closer look.\n\n**[\\> Try Brevo for free](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/sendinblue)**\n\n### 2\\. Sender\n\n[![Image 4: sender](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sender.net_.png)](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/sender)\n\n[Sender](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/sender) is an excellent alternative to MailerLite, especially if you're on a budget and looking for an email platform that offers a generous free plan. The Free Forever plan offers unlimited automation, 24/7 chat support, and you can send 15,000 monthly emails to up to 2,500 subscribers.\n\nThanks to the drag-and-drop email builder and a wide selection of responsive templates, you can create these emails in minutes. You can also save time by picking a pre-made automated workflow template and quickly creating emails like welcome sequences, abandoned cart reminders, and thank-you notes.\n\nAs your business scales, you can enhance your campaigns with powerful SMS features, audience segmentation, and popups to capture leads more effectively. Real-time reporting and a newsletter heatmap provide instant insights into what\u2019s working and what needs tweaking.\n\n#### Where Sender beats MailerLite:\n\nEven on the free plan, you\u2019ll have access to customer service round the clock, something that MailerLite doesn't offer. For MailerLite, priority support is for paid plan users only.\n\nIn addition, Sender\u2019s automation tools are robust, allowing you to set up unlimited automated workflows, even on the free tier. This is ideal for businesses on a budget that are looking to save time and streamline their email marketing processes.\n\n#### Where MailerLite wins:\n\nMailerLite stands out with its additional advanced features, like a website builder and [landing page creator](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/free-landing-page/) \u2014 tools that Sender currently doesn\u2019t offer. These features make MailerLite a more comprehensive platform if you want to create a website and manage your email marketing campaigns in one place.\n\n#### When we\u2019d recommend Sender:\n\nSender is perfect for marketers who are just getting started or those who want an easy-to-use email marketing platform without sacrificing powerful automation tools. In short, it's your go-to option if you want a platform that offers a generous free plan with unlimited email automation, responsive templates, and excellent customer service.\n\n[\\> Try Sender for free](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/sender)\n\n### 3\\. Moosend\n\n![Image 5: moosend homepage](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/moosend-homepage-e1691156721868.png)\n\nThis is an obvious one and one of the best alternatives. The two share many similarities, especially when it comes to their easy-to-use drag-and-drop editors. But what really stands out for [Moosend](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/moosend/) is its affordable pricing, which starts at $9/month \u2013 and includes unlimited emails, plus automations, transactional emails, and landing pages.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. You've got the power to A/B test subject lines, as well as insert email countdown timers to ramp up urgency. Another bonus is the ability to directly drop comments and feedback on designs within the tool, which is a feature you won\u2019t readily find in other email marketing services.\n\nIts automations are also impressive, with an intuitive automation builder, and a wide range of templates to start from (e.g. abandoned carts campaigns, upsell emails, anniversary flows).\n\n#### Where Moosend beats MailerLite:\n\nMoosend comes with a handy feature for free spam and design testing. This checks if your email can dodge the spam filters across big-name email clients and even gives you tips to improve your design. With MailerLite, you can sneak a peek at how your design looks on desktop and mobile but you can\u2019t view it across various email clients or test for spam.\n\nMoosend also comes out stronger in terms of automations, with a solid range of \u201crecipes\u201d to get started with, and the option to trigger automations based on website/product views (which is not available with MailerLite).\n\n#### Where MailerLite wins:\n\nMoosend recently removed its free plan, so if you were hoping to use Moosend for free, it\u2019s sadly not an option (as it is with MailerLite). However, it does offer a free 30-day trial to let you test the platform out.\n\nWe also found Moosend\u2019s selection of [signup forms](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/newsletter-sign-up-examples/) and email templates to be more limited than MailerLite\u2019s. And its deliverability rates were average, lagging behind MailerLite\u2019s.\n\n#### When we\u2019d recommend Moosend:\n\nMoosend\u2019s pricing is extremely competitive and comes with a stack of useful extras, so anyone looking for a budget-friendly yet versatile tool should seriously consider Moosend.\n\n**[\\> Try Moosend for free](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/moosend)**\n\n### 4\\. GetResponse\n\n![Image 6: getresponse cheap email marketing](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/getresponse-cheap-email-marketing-e1693485540470.png)\n\n[GetResponse](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/getresponse/) offers a wide selection of features, including the ability to host your own webinars \u2013 something we haven\u2019t found in any other email marketing service! Yet, it avoids overwhelming users with a steep learning curve. In fact, it's remarkably user-friendly.\n\nThe email service provider boasts an intuitive drag-and-drop email builder, allowing you to infuse your branding, fonts, colors, and media.\n\nDespite being at the [pricier](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/getresponse/pricing/) end of the spectrum, GetResponse justifies its cost with a comprehensive library of pre-built automations. These cover everything from winback campaigns and welcome sequences to post-purchase retargeting and loyalty campaigns, all of which can be customized to fit your specific needs.\n\nIt's a powerful tool that manages to balance complexity with accessibility, making it a strong choice for those looking to create sophisticated campaigns without the headaches.\n\n#### GetResponse video review:\n\n![Image 7: getresponse video review](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/video-banner-40959-1.jpg)\n\n#### Where GetResponse beats MailerLite:\n\nOn paper, both offer a similar feature range, including landing pages, a [website builder](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/best-website-builder-with-email-marketing/), the ability to sell products, and AI assistant. But GetResponse takes it even further, with additional features such as webinars, live chat widgets, and [sales funnels](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/sales-funnel-software/) (note that most of these require GetResponse\u2019s higher-level plans).\n\nGetResponse\u2019s reporting and contact management features are also stronger than MailerLite\u2019s. For example, GetResponse lets you add a wide range of conditions to segment your subscriber list automatically. It also allows you to deep dive into everything from contact data, to newsletter and automation performance.\n\n#### Where MailerLite wins:\n\nTo access additional automations and advanced segmentation with GetResponse, you\u2019ll need to upgrade from the affordable Email Marketing plan (from $19/month) to the Marketing Automation plan \u2013 and there is a significant jump in cost.\n\nIt\u2019s also not so budget-friendly for ecommerce owners \u2013 features such as ecommerce tracking and abandoned cart emails require the _very_ pricey Ecommerce Marketing plan (starting at around $100/month).\n\nFinally, our testing has revealed that the deliverability rates are much lower compared to MailerLite.\n\n#### When we\u2019d recommend GetResponse:\n\nGetResponse is ideal for sales-driven small and medium-sized businesses in search of a comprehensive marketing tool. With its blend of advanced automations, sales funnel tools, CRM, and an integrated webinar solution, it offers great value considering the array of features available.\n\n**[\\> Try GetResponse for free](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/getresponse)**\n\n### 5\\. SendPulse\n\n![Image 8: sendpulse cheap email marketing](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sendpulse-cheap-email-marketing-e1693485336927.png)\n\nSendPulse provides a complete marketing ecosystem, including an affordable email marketing software that lets users craft attractive branded emails. One noteworthy feature is its built-in spam checker, which can help you steer clear of blacklists and [boost deliverability](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/email-deliverability-best-practices/).\n\nWith SendPulse, you can send [automated emails](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/automated-email-examples/) such as welcome emails, abandoned cart reminders, and notifications based on user behavior. As your business evolves, you can add on extras such as [chatbots](https://www.tooltester.com/en/blog/best-ai-chatbot/), web push notifications, and SMS campaigns to align with your needs.\n\nFeatures like email marketing, transactional emails, sales CRM, landing pages, chatbots, and more are included with SendPulse\u2019s generous free plan, which lets you send 15,000 marketing emails to 500 subscribers monthly.\n\n#### Where SendPulse beats MailerLite:\n\nWith SendPulse, you get a full marketing platform for sending marketing emails, SMSes, web push notifications, chatbots, and more. You\u2019ll miss out on many of these features with MailerLite.\n\nIn addition to marketing emails, the free plan also gives you a generous allowance of 12,000 transactional emails per month. MailerLite\u2019s transactional email service only allows for 3,000 free emails per month.\n\n#### Where MailerLite wins:\n\nWe find MailerLite\u2019s interface to be easier to navigate than SendPulse, with SendPulse\u2019s editor at times buggy and slow. Automations are also much easier to set up with MailerLite as SendPulse\u2019s autoresponder editor isn\u2019t very intuitive.\n\nIn terms of transactional emails, we also found MailerLite\u2019s MailerSend service to hit much higher [deliverability](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/free-smtp-servers/#Deliverability_Scores) rates than SendPulse.\n\n#### When we\u2019d recommend SendPulse:\n\nOpt for SendPulse if you're seeking the robust features and capabilities usually found in pricey email marketing tools but without the hefty cost. What makes SendPulse stand out is its adaptability; it grows with you, allowing you to incorporate more channels as your business scales. If you have ambitious goals, SendPulse is a solid choice.\n\n**[\\> Try SendPulse out for free](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/sendpulse)**\n\n### 6\\. Omnisend\n\n![Image 9: omnisend cheap email marketing](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/omnisend-cheap-email-marketing-e1693485436351.png)\n\n[Omnisend](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/omnisend/) is our top pick if you\u2019re running an online store. Its wide range of ecommerce automations (including [abandoned cart sequences](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/abandoned-cart-templates/), order confirmations, and back-in-stock reminders), and niche ecommerce features makes it one of the [best email marketing solutions for ecommerce](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/best-email-marketing-for-ecommerce/).\n\nBy \u201cniche features\u201d, we mean a wheel of fortune form to incentivize sign-ups, interactive gift boxes, automated product recommendations, and live view website tracking \u2013 which you definitely won\u2019t find in most email marketing services (and certainly not in MailerLite!).\n\nWith Omnisend, you can even incorporate push notifications and SMS automations into your campaigns, making it an ideal option for [omnichannel marketing](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/omnichannel-software/).\n\n#### Omnisend video review:\n\n![Image 10: omnisend video review](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/video-banner-41001-1.jpg)\n\n#### Where Omnisend beats MailerLite:\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Omnisend is much stronger in the ecommerce game. It integrates with more ecommerce platforms (including OpenCart and BigCommerce), and as we mentioned before, offers interesting features to help store owners boost email sales.\n\nWith Omnisend, you can also segment new subscribers based on specific details (e.g. customers who purchased a specific product), which can help you [target](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/targeted-email-marketing/) your emails better.\n\n#### Where MailerLite wins:\n\nWhile you do get access to email templates on Omnisend\u2019s free plan (which you don\u2019t with MailerLite), its template range is pretty limited. Its designs also aren\u2019t as eye-catching as MailerLite\u2019s.\n\nDeliverability also doesn\u2019t seem to be one of Omnisend\u2019s strong points, as we discovered in our tests. MailerLite has a much better track record in this regard.\n\n#### When we\u2019d recommend Omnisend:\n\nPrice-wise, Omnisend comes out [slightly higher](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/omnisend/pricing/) than MailerLite \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it if you run an online store. Omnisend\u2019s wider range of ecommerce integrations, automations, and email features can make a huge difference in driving sales from your email campaigns.\n\n**[\\> Try Omnisend for free](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/omnisend)**\n\n### 7\\. ActiveCampaign\n\n![Image 11: activecampaign for agencies](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/activecampaign-for-agencies-e1693485505665.png)\n\nIf you find MailerLite\u2019s automations too basic, you\u2019ll want to check out [ActiveCampaign](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/activecampaign/). With ActiveCampaign, you gain the power to automate responses based on your website visitors' behavior, employing intricate if/when/then logic. In our view, it\u2019s one of the best platforms for automation and contact segmentation.\n\nThis also extends to its comprehensive [CRM](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/crm/activecampaign-review/) (available as an add-on product), which simplifies the management of sales directly from the backend, and allows you to better target \u2018at risk\u2019 or \u2018hot\u2019 leads.\n\nEmbracing the growing trend around AI, ActiveCampaign has also introduced a content generator that leverages the [GPT](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/creating-a-newsletter-with-chatgpt/) engine, which can help you [write newsletters](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/how-to-write-a-newsletter/) with very little effort.\n\n#### ActiveCampaign video review:\n\n![Image 12: activecampaign video review](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/video-banner-40983-1.jpg)\n\n#### Where ActiveCampaign beats MailerLite:\n\nActiveCampaign stands out with its advanced automation features, surpassing the capabilities of most of the email marketing software we\u2019ve reviewed here. With around 900 workflows to start from, there\u2019s virtually no limit to the [sales](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/crm-with-automation/) and marketing processes you can automate.\n\nActiveCampaign also offers more sophisticated reporting than MailerLite, with deeper insights into email performance, behavioral data, and deal pipelines.\n\n#### Where MailerLite wins:\n\nWith such an extensive range of features, it\u2019s no surprise that ActiveCampaign is the more expensive option, with [plans](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/activecampaign/pricing/) starting at $19 plan (no free plan is available).\n\nMailerLite is also the more beginner-friendly email marketing platform, with a more intuitive backend and a shallower learning curve than ActiveCampaign. Read more about [MailerLite vs ActiveCampaign](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/mailerlite-vs-activecampaign/) in our complete guide.\n\n#### When we\u2019d recommend ActiveCampaign:\n\nActiveCampaign is an especially good fit for power users such as ecommerce stores and B2B companies looking to optimize their lead generation process through the integrated CRM. Additionally, [marketing agencies](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/email-marketing-software-for-agencies/) might find ActiveCampaign's white labeling features particularly useful.\n\n**[\\> Try ActiveCampaign for free](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/activecampaign)**\n\n### 8\\. Mailjet\n\n![Image 13: mailjet cheap email marketing](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mailjet-cheap-email-marketing-e1693485394848.png)\n\n[Mailjet](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/mailjet/) is geared towards collaborative email marketing, particularly for small teams. Its standout collaboration feature allows entire teams to work on an email in real time. Coupled with a wide range of features (including SMS marketing), Mailjet presents a versatile and collaboration-friendly alternative to MailerLite.\n\nWhat sets Mailjet apart further is its integration of email marketing with email API services, all in one platform. In fact, most of Mailjet\u2019s [transactional email](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/best-transactional-email-service/) features are available right off the bat on its free plan, which lets you send up to 6,000 emails a month.\n\nWhile Mailjet is an affordable email marketing software, be mindful that costs can escalate if you require advanced features like automations, [A/B testing](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/email-ab-testing/), and [dynamic content](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/dynamic-content-in-emails/).\n\n#### Where Mailjet beats MailerLite:\n\nIt\u2019s hard to beat [Mailjet\u2019s competitive pricing](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/mailjet/pricing/) for basic email campaigns. Unlike MailerLite, Mailjet charges based on monthly email sends rather than list size. If you have a large list but don\u2019t plan to send more than 15,000 emails per month, the Premium plan will cost you just $15/month. (By comparison, a monthly subscription to MailerLite for 15,000 contacts will cost you close to $100/month!)\n\nIts real-time collaboration is also a novel concept in email marketing (picture the collaborative capabilities of Google Docs but in an email editor). Team members can comment and lock sections to prevent simultaneous edits by others, while the campaign approval process allows managers to have the final say and sign off on campaigns.\n\n#### Where MailerLite wins:\n\nCompared to MailerLite, Mailjet\u2019s segmentation conditions are more restrictive, with only basic filtering conditions available, and limited filters for email engagement. In general, we found [list management](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/email-list-management/) to be more user-friendly with MailerLite. For example, while MailerLite automatically unsubscribes hard bounces, Mailjet makes this a manual task.\n\nWe also found the automation conditions a bit too limited, lacking conditions like \u2018if opened/unopened'. It\u2019s a big drawback that you can't edit workflows once activated, or reactivate an inactive workflow.\n\nMailerLite\u2019s landing page and website builder also make it the more comprehensive platform if you\u2019re looking to run [lead generation](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/email-marketing-lead-generation/) campaigns.\n\n#### When we\u2019d recommend Mailjet:\n\nMailjet caters to small teams seeking a collaborative approach (for example, agency users), and is also well-suited for less-technical users, thanks to its no-code templates. It\u2019s also a strong option for sending transactional emails. If you value seamless integration, Mailjet's wide range of integrations with ecommerce platforms, CRMs, and social media, will be particularly appealing.\n\n**[\\> Try Mailjet for free](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/mailjet)**\n\n### 9\\. MailChimp\n\n![Image 14: mailchimp homepage](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mailchimp-homepage-e1691156676201.png)\n\nThis email marketing giant hardly needs an introduction. It\u2019s MailerLite\u2019s biggest competitor, with both sharing similar reputations as user-friendly marketing tools for small-to-medium businesses.\n\nBut there are a few reasons why [MailChimp](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/mailchimp/) is not as high on this list as you might expect. The biggest one is [price](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/mailchimp/pricing/), with MailChimp charging between 20-50% more than MailerLite for similar-sized subscriber lists. We also find that subscriber management can get complicated with MailChimp (as you\u2019ll see in a second).\n\nStill, MailChimp does have its strengths. It offers a much wider range of automations than MailerLite, including advanced ecommerce flows. And its reporting features are also more comprehensive, with the ability to track activity from social media (which isn\u2019t available with MailerLite).\n\n#### MailChimp video review:\n\n![Image 15: mailchimp video review](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/video-banner-41007-1.jpg)\n\n#### Where MailChimp beats MailerLite:\n\nWhile MailerLite provides basic reporting and ecommerce tracking for Shopify and [WooCommerce](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/best-email-marketing-for-woocommerce/), it lacks social media tracking and information on email clients. MailChimp lets you pull in data from a wider range of ecommerce platforms (including Shopify, Magento, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, PrestaShop, and more) and includes social media and email client data.\n\nAnother bonus with Mailchimp is that you can preview how your email will look on various email clients, with 25 Inbox Preview tokens to use every month (on paid plans).\n\n#### Where MailerLite wins:\n\nAside from the more affordable price tag for paid plans, MailerLite\u2019s free plan allows for 1,000 subscribers and 12,000 monthly emails, which is much more generous than Mailchimp's 500 subscribers and 1,000-email limit. You also won\u2019t be charged for unsubscribed or bounced contacts, as you would with MailChimp.\n\nFeatures-wise, MailerLite offers a more user-friendly approach to list management, allowing segmentation and automation for moving subscribers between groups and charging for subscribers only once regardless of the number of groups or segments they belong to.\n\nMailChimp also isn\u2019t appropriate if you\u2019re an affiliate marketer, as this is an industry that\u2019s prohibited in its Terms of Use.\n\n#### When we\u2019d recommend MailChimp:\n\nMailChimp makes more sense if having a wider range of integrations is important to you, and if you need more comprehensive reporting. Also, check out our [MailerLite vs MailChimp](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/mailerlite-vs-mailchimp) guide for a more detailed look into how they compare.\n\n**[\\> Try MailChimp for free](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/mailchimp-email-services)**\n\n### 10\\. Constant Contact\n\n### ![Image 16: constant contact](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/constant-contact-homepage.png)\n\n[Constant Contact](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/constant-contact/) is another big name in email marketing, having been around since 1995. It remains relatively popular, although its outdated editor and backend make it seem like a dinosaur compared to the email service providers on this list \u2013 and a more expensive one at that.\n\nStill, it offers a few features that are niche in the industry. These include the ability to manage event invitations, registrations, and tickets (via their Eventbrite integration), plus social media scheduling, logo creation, and digital product selling.\n\nIt also provides integrations with thousands of apps and consistently performs well in our deliverability tests.\n\n#### Constant Contact video review:\n\n![Image 17: constant contact video review](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/video-banner-41031-1.jpg)\n\n#### Where Constant Contact beats MailerLite:\n\nIf you run regular events, Constant Contact\u2019s event management features can help you streamline the invitation and registration process. Bear in mind that this feature comes at a cost: 5.4% + $0.80 for each ticket sold or transaction conducted.\n\n#### Where MailerLite wins:\n\nConstant Contact's autoresponders are fairly basic, offering only welcome and anniversary emails, along with triggered automations based on opens and clicks.\n\nThe email templates look a bit dated, and registration forms are also basic, with no option to add custom fields.\n\nWe\u2019ve found that MailerLite\u2019s customer support tends to be easier to reach. Lastly, considering the lack of advanced features, [Constant Contact's pricing](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/constant-contact/pricing/) (which starts at $50 for a small list of 2,500 contacts), is not as competitive as MailerLite\u2019s.\n\n#### When we\u2019d recommend Constant Contact:\n\nWhile Constant Contact is a much pricier tool than MailerLite (with little to justify this premium), it\u2019s an interesting option if you run regular events and want to manage invitations and registrations within a single platform.\n\n[**\\> Try Constant Contact for free**](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/constant-contact-cta)\n\n### 11\\. Kit\n\n![Image 18: convertkit free](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/convertkit-free.png)\n\nDesigned to serve the unique needs of [bloggers](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/email-marketing-for-bloggers/) and creators, [Kit](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/convertkit/) offers a range of features that go beyond simple email marketing. From crafting beautiful email campaigns to visual automations to setting up intricate \u201cif this, then that\u201d sequences, the email marketing software also allows for advanced subscriber segmentation options and even direct product sales.\n\nWhat stands out is the Creator Network feature, which helps you grow your audience through partnerships with other creators. While Kit\u2019s forms and landing pages may be basic, they are incredibly user-friendly and compatible with all major blogging platforms.\n\nAnother interesting feature is the ability to convert your emails into web pages and monetize access to them, a particularly useful function if you offer [paid newsletters](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/how-to-monetize-a-newsletter/).\n\n#### Kit video review:\n\n![Image 19: convertkit video review](https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/video-banner-41025-1.jpg)\n\n#### Where Kit beats MailerLite:\n\nKit lets you easily set up email sequences and build out visual workflows for automation. What's especially useful is the tagging feature, which lets you tailor your messages based on actions like link clicks or form submissions. It\u2019s also handy for sending targeted emails to specific groups, e.g. new vs. repeat customers. Doing something similar with MailerLite takes a bit more effort (using \u201cgroups\u201d rather than \u201ctags\u201d).\n\nThe Creator Network is also a unique feature that can help to grow your newsletter\u2019s audience through cross-promotion and recommendations.\n\n#### Where MailerLite wins:\n\n[Kit\u2019s pricing plans](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/reviews/convertkit/pricing/) are on the higher side, particularly when stacked against more feature-rich services like MailerLite.\n\nThe email design choices are also limited, with a scant selection of templates. And the landing page editor leaves a lot to be desired in terms of user-friendliness and template quality.\n\nYou can read more in our [MailerLite vs Kit](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/blog/mailerlite-vs-convertkit/) comparison.\n\n#### Where we\u2019d recommend Kit:\n\nKit is recommended for marketers and creators who want to run highly targeted automated campaigns, thanks to its robust tagging and segmentation features. It's also ideal for those looking to manage their entire campaign, including landing pages, within a single platform. If you're a creative professional aiming to sell digital products or subscriptions, Kit's unique and easy-to-use digital selling feature\u2014available even on the free plan\u2014makes it a compelling choice.\n\n**[\\> Try Kit for free](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/convertkit)**\n\nMailerLite Alternatives: Conclusion\n-----------------------------------\n\nWhile MailerLite offers a wide range of features and excellent value for money, it does fall short in some areas \u2013 especially where advanced functionalities are concerned.\n\n*   If you're on a **budget** but still want to harness the power of email marketing, consider cheaper options like [Brevo](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/sendinblue), [Sender](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/sender), [Moosend](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/moosend), and [SendPulse](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/sendpulse).\n*   For those in need of more sophisticated **automations**, [ActiveCampaign](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/activecampaign) and [GetResponse](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/getresponse) lead the pack.\n*   When it comes to **transactional emails**, all-in-one services like Brevo, SendPulse, and [Mailjet](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/mailjet) are better options.\n*   **Ecommerce businesses** should turn to [Omnisend](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/omnisend) or [Mailchimp](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/mailchimp-email-services) for a wider range of ecommerce integrations and specialized features.\n*   **Event organizers** might find [Constant Contact](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/constant-contact-cta) particularly useful.\n*   Lastly, **content creators** could benefit from [Kit's](https://www.emailtooltester.com/out/convertkit) tailored offerings and Creator Network.\n\nWith these MailerLite alternatives, you're bound to find a service that matches your specific needs \u2013 so if any of these have caught your attention, we\u2019d encourage you to try them out for free.\n\n_Still need help picking out a MailerLite alternative?

      "title": "6 Best MailerLite Alternatives 2024 - 3 Are Completely Free",
      "content": "There are tons of MailerLite alternatives designed for email marketers and business owners. But some of them have similar downsides to MailerLite, and others just aren\u2019t worth your time.\n\nWith MailerLite, you get a fraction of the responsive templates and software integrations that other services provide. This platform also lacks many standard tools, such as marketing automation templates, SMS marketing, and social ads. **If you go with MailerLite, you\u2019ll struggle to automate your marketing efforts and streamline your sales process, which can lead to wasted time and unnecessary expenses.**\n\nMany marketers compare MailerLite vs. Mailchimp, but I\u2019ve found several better options. Email marketing services with advanced automations, transactional emails, and built-in tools or app integrations let me work more efficiently and increase the return on investment (ROI) that I can generate for my agency clients. **I tested all the major MailerLite competitors so you can identify the email marketing service with the right features and best value for your business.**\n\n**Short on Time? These Are the Best MailerLite Alternatives in 2024:**\n\n*   [**ActiveCampaign**](https://www.websiteplanet.com/goto.php?id=2175&lang=en&deep_id=0&deep_name=&btn_name=VendorExternalUrl_2175_post_1855439_282445&post_id=1855439&pageview_id=0&direct_link=&type=post&amp=0) \u2013 Best for sales automation\n*   [**Benchmark**](https://www.websiteplanet.com/goto.php?id=2168&lang=en&deep_id=0&deep_name=&btn_name=VendorExternalUrl_2168_post_1855439_282446&post_id=1855439&pageview_id=0&direct_link=&type=post&amp=0) \u2013 Has hundreds of email templates and app integrations\n*   [**GetResponse**](https://www.websiteplanet.com/goto.php?id=2144&lang=en&deep_id=0&deep_name=&btn_name=VendorExternalUrl_2144_post_1855439_282447&post_id=1855439&pageview_id=0&direct_link=&type=post&amp=0) \u2013 Best for automated marketing funnels\n*   [**Jump down to see other email marketing services we recommend**](https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/best-mailerlite-alternatives/#sendinblue)\n*   [**Comparison table**](https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/best-mailerlite-alternatives/#comparison-table)\n*   [**FAQ**](https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/best-mailerlite-alternatives/#faq)\n\nWhat We Look For in the Best Alternatives to MailerLite\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen testing other options, I looked for features that MailerLite lacks, such as:\n\n*   **Responsive email templates:**\u00a0MailerLite has several categories of responsive templates, including e-commerce, events, and blog updates. Yet the platform\u2019s template gallery has only 62\u00a0designs in total. Because premade designs can save you time, I looked for options with even more responsive templates.\n*   **Stock image gallery:**\u00a0High-quality stock images can look great in emails and provide a cost-effective alternative to original photos. **MailerLite doesn\u2019t include stock photos, so you\u2019d have to provide your own.**\u00a0I sought out an email platform with a large image library available at no extra cost.\n*   **Automated workflows:**\u00a0Designing marketing automations can be tough for advanced marketers and impossible for beginners. Unlike most platforms, MailerLite doesn\u2019t have any premade automations, which could make it unusable for some people. **I searched for an alternative option with easy-to-use pre-built automations.**\n*   **Complementary marketing channels:**\u00a0For many companies, email is just one part of a more complex marketing stack. However, MailerLite focuses primarily on email and doesn\u2019t have other built-in tools. I looked for a platform that would add more value with e-commerce, SMS marketing, and chatbot tools.\n*   **App integrations:**\u00a0If you want to use complex automations or connect all your client records in a customer relationship management (CRM) tool, you need an easy way to integrate programs. MailerLite supports just over 100 app integrations, which is relatively low. I searched for a platform with hundreds of direct integrations that would significantly enhance functionality.\n\n[1\\. ActiveCampaign \u2013 Best for Sales Automation](https://www.websiteplanet.com/goto.php?id=2175&lang=en&deep_id=0&deep_name=&btn_name=VendorExternalUrl_2175_post_1855439_282455&post_id=1855439&pageview_id=0&direct_link=&type=post&amp=0)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith its premade marketing automations, dynamic content options, and CRM tool, ActiveCampaign is designed to help marketers work more efficiently. This platform also includes one of the most user-friendly editors available (as I found out in my in-depth [ActiveCampaign review](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/activecampaign/)), which means you can easily customize email templates to meet your company\u2019s needs.\n\nIn addition to email marketing tools, ActiveCampaign has built-in SMS marketing and chatbots to help you nurture leads outside of email. **Because this platform has some of the most advanced machine learning technology, I think ActiveCampaign\u00a0would be a smart pick for tech-savvy teams that need to improve automation throughout their marketing stack.**\n\nActiveCampaign may have plenty of powerful features, but you\u2019ll have to pay for all that functionality. **This platform is one of the highest-priced options on this list and may not fit into every company\u2019s budget**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but there is a **14-day free trial**\u00a0on offer where you can see if you think it\u2019s worth the money.\u00a0If you\u2019re looking for a more affordable platform, consider an email marketing service like [AWeber](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/aweber/) or [GetResponse](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/getresponse/) instead.\n\n### **ActiveCampaign Features**\n\n![Image 1: ActiveCampaign automated workflow designer](https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6-best-mailerlite-alternatives-anna-sonnenberg-1.png)\n\nActiveCampaign has dozens of easily customizable automation templates\n\nWith ActiveCampaign, you get:\n\n*   **Premade automation templates:**\u00a0ActiveCampaign has around **500 pre-built marketing automations**, which means you don\u2019t have to take the time to make them from scratch. They cover a wide range of marketing needs, from subscriber engagement and customer loyalty to e-commerce and online training. ActiveCampaign also has an Automation Marketplace which includes third-party automations created by companies which you can import.\n*   **Powerful CRM tool:**\u00a0Not only does ActiveCampaign have a native CRM, but it also comes with helpful sales automation features. When contacts fill out your form, you can automatically send welcome emails and lead nurturing sequences. You can also automate sales team notifications to keep everyone updated.\n*   **Automated lead scoring:**\u00a0Some leads are more valuable than others, and ActiveCampaign can help you track ratings with automated lead scoring. This feature can identify changes in subscriber engagement and automatically notify your sales team so they can quickly\u00a0follow up hot leads.\n*   **Machine learning technology:**\u00a0Analyzing email marketing data takes time and expertise, but ActiveCampaign\u2019s machine learning technology can help. This platform offers predictive sending and predictive content so you can send subscribers the right information at the optimal time.\n\n[2\\. Benchmark \u2013 Has Hundreds of Email Templates and App Integrations](https://www.websiteplanet.com/goto.php?id=2168&lang=en&deep_id=0&deep_name=&btn_name=VendorExternalUrl_2168_post_1855439_280326&post_id=1855439&pageview_id=0&direct_link=&type=post&amp=0)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom its user-friendly email editor and huge template library to its pre-built marketing automations and landing pages, Benchmark is designed to help small businesses build their lists and connect with customers efficiently. **Unlike MailerLite, Benchmark also has tools to help you improve your email marketing results, like a built-in spam checker**.\n\nAlthough Benchmark\u2019s strengths lie in its focus on email, this platform easily connects to other marketing apps. **Thanks to its hundreds of software integrations, I think Benchmark would be a great choice for businesses that want to streamline all of their marketing efforts.**\n\nWhile Benchmark\u2019s many integrations add a lot of value, this platform doesn\u2019t have many native tools beyond email marketing. If you want an email marketing service with a built-in e-commerce solution, SMS marketing tool, or chatbot builder, I recommend an option like [Constant Contact](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/constantcontact/).\n\n### **Benchmark Features**\n\n![Image 2: Benchmark email template library](https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6-best-mailerlite-alternatives-anna-sonnenberg-2.png)\n\nBenchmark has hundreds of responsive email templates organized in helpful categories\n\nWith Benchmark, you get:\n\n*   **Hundreds of responsive templates: Benchmark has 500\u00a0email templates, available on all plans**, or over eight times the number MailerLite offers. With Benchmark, you can narrow down your template search by type \u2013 like newsletters or announcements \u2013\u00a0or by industry \u2013\u00a0like health and fitness or food and beverage \u2013\u00a0to find the ideal design.\u00a0There\u2019s also a huge offering of holiday-specific templates.\n*   **User-friendly drag-and-drop editor:** I found Benchmark\u2019s template editor much more intuitive than MailerLite\u2019s. If you want to add more elements to your email campaign, Benchmark\u2019s drag-and-drop editor makes the process simple \u2013 it\u2019s why it scored so highly for ease of use in [our Benchmark review](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/benchmark/). You can easily insert, remove, or customize buttons, videos, and social media links.\n*   **Over 1,500 marketing integrations:**\u00a0Benchmark connects to over 10 times the number of apps that MailerLite does. Benchmark\u2019s integrations range from social media and CRM tools to e-commerce and chat apps, which add much more functionality to this email marketing service.\n*   **Valuable add-ons:**\u00a0Benchmark has several features that you can add on to any plan for an extra fee. You can pay to host more images, have your list verified, preview your email campaigns on any device, or get a dedicated IP. MailerLite also has a few add-ons available, but many seem overly expensive, like $100 per month for priority support.\n\n[3\\. GetResponse \u2013 Best for Automated Marketing Funnels](https://www.websiteplanet.com/goto.php?id=2144&lang=en&deep_id=0&deep_name=&btn_name=VendorExternalUrl_2144_post_1855439_280331&post_id=1855439&pageview_id=0&direct_link=&type=post&amp=0)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**With over 200 responsive email templates, a split-testing tool, and one of the largest stock image galleries, [GetResponse has everything most companies need for email marketing](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/getresponse/).**\u00a0Yet as an automation platform, GetResponse offers much more than email. This platform also includes unlimited landing pages, an e-commerce solution, and even webinars.\n\nIn addition, GetResponse provides lead scoring to help you identify the most valuable prospects and funnels to automate your marketing and sales efforts. **Because of its advanced automation features, lead scoring, and funnels, I think GetResponse would be optimal for companies that need to prioritize lead generation.**\n\nWhile this platform has many more native tools than MailerLite does, GetResponse doesn\u2019t have a free plan. **If you want a free email marketing service, I\u2019d suggest taking advantage of GetResponse\u2019s 30-day free trial or looking at AWeber\u2019s free plan\u00a0instead.**\n\n### **GetResponse Features**\n\n![Image 3: GetResponse conversion funnel designer](https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6-best-mailerlite-alternatives-anna-sonnenberg-3.png)\n\nGetResponse\u2019s funnels include features like social ads, subscription forms, landing pages, and automated emails\n\nWith GetResponse, you get:\n\n*   **Built-in spam check:**\u00a0The GetResponse spam test tool identifies potential spam triggers, including text and design elements. This feature gives you a chance to\u00a0fix issues before sending and get your messages into inboxes. MailerLite doesn\u2019t have a spam check, which could cause deliverability issues.\n*   **Extensive stock photo collection:**\u00a0GetResponse has 5,000 stock images in its library,\u00a0and they\u2019re available on all plans.\u00a0**You can also use the built-in Giphy library to search and add GIFs to your email campaigns.**\u00a0MailerLite doesn\u2019t have stock images, so you would have to source photos from elsewhere.\n*   **Webinars:**\u00a0GetResponse is one of only a handful of email marketing services with\u00a0a native webinar tool. Depending on the plan you choose, you can host live, on-demand, or paid webinars to connect with your audience and sell to prospects. This would be a great tool for lead generation, and it\u2019s an option that MailerLite doesn\u2019t have.\n*   **Conversion funnels:**\u00a0MailerLite also lacks funnels, but GetResponse includes unlimited lead funnels with every plan,\u00a0plus\u00a0sales and webinar funnels with higher-priced plans. These automated workflows can help you guide subscribers from the awareness stage to the conversion stage, increasing the ROI of your campaigns.\n\nFrom its email templates and A/B testing options to its marketing automations and advanced segmentation, [Sendinblue has a solid list of email marketing features](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/sendinblue/). This platform also has several native tools that other platforms like MailerLite don\u2019t have, such as chatbots, SMS marketing, and social ads.\n\n**Sendinblue has one of the best free email marketing plans available** (more on that below), and its paid plans come with greater capacity and advanced analytics. Because this platform offers so much value at every level,\u00a0**I think Sendinblue would be great for companies that want to start building an email list for free and graduate to a paid plan when the ROI is right.**\n\nAlthough Sendinblue allows up to three users for higher-priced plans, free and lower-priced plans include only one user. If you have a big team or if you\u2019re managing email marketing for clients, I\u2019d suggest a service that\u2019s better designed for multiple users, such as [ActiveCampaign](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/activecampaign/) or [AWeber](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/aweber/).\n\n### **Sendinblue Features**\n\n![Image 4: Sendinblue email template gallery](https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6-best-mailerlite-alternatives-anna-sonnenberg-4.png)\n\nSendinblue has templates for newsletters, automations, and transactional emails\n\nWith Sendinblue, you get:\n\n*   **Transactional emails:**\u00a0MailerLite has standard promotional emails and automated workflows, but it lacks transactional emails. **Sendinblue provides transactional emails and SMS messages with every plan, even the free account.**\u00a0You can use transactional sending to trigger messages like password resets, purchase confirmations, or account notifications.\n*   **SMS marketing:**\u00a0Along with email marketing, every Sendinblue plan also includes SMS marketing \u2013\u00a0a feature that MailerLite doesn\u2019t have. With SMS, you can send personalized text messages to subscribers to\u00a0increase brand awareness and sale, although this does come at an extra cost per SMS message.\n*   **Chatbots:**\u00a0MailerLite doesn\u2019t have chatbots, but Sendinblue includes chatbots in every plan. With chatbots, you can set up a messaging window on your website, where you can communicate directly with visitors and nurture leads.\n*   **Superior free plan:** MailerLite has a decent free plan, but **Sendinblue\u2019s free option**\u00a0is better. In addition to email marketing, transactional emails, and marketing automations, the free plan also includes SMS marketing and chatbots. That means you can get started with multiple marketing channels for free.\n\n[5\\. Constant Contact \u2013 Provides a Total Marketing Platform](https://www.websiteplanet.com/goto.php?id=2162&lang=en&deep_id=0&deep_name=&btn_name=VendorExternalUrl_2162_post_1855439_280343&post_id=1855439&pageview_id=0&direct_link=&type=post&amp=0)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Constant Contact is a beginner-friendly email marketing tool with over 100 responsive templates, a stock image gallery, and basic marketing automations.** This platform also offers built-in marketing features like an e-commerce tool, a website builder, social ads, and more, which we discovered in our [Constant Contact review](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/constantcontact/). All plans allow multiple users, making this service a good pick for teams.\n\nConstant Contact supports over 500 marketing integrations, and you can connect it to everything from social media and event apps to business management and CRM software. **Because it has such a great balance between built-in tools and external integrations, I think Constant Contact would work well for teams that need an all-in-one marketing platform.**\n\nLike MailerLite, Constant Contact prices its plans based on list size. However, **Constant Contact doesn\u2019t have a free plan, and its lowest-priced plan is one of the more expensive options of its kind on the market**\u00a0(although it does have a generous **60-day free trial** if you\u2019re based in the US \u2013 30 days for everyone else). If you\u2019re on a budget, I would recommend a platform with a free plan, such as **AWeber free plan**.\n\n### **Constant Contact Features**\n\n![Image 5: Constant Contact marketing calendar](https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6-best-mailerlite-alternatives-anna-sonnenberg-5.png)\n\nConstant Contact\u2019s marketing calendar supports email, social media, ads, and landing pages\n\nWith Constant Contact, you get:\n\n*   **E-commerce tools:**\u00a0Most email marketing platforms have e-commerce integrations, but few have built-in solutions. **Constant Contact has an e-commerce tool that lets you sell unlimited items, including digital products and downloads.**\u00a0With a payment processor, a shipping manager, and an inventory tool, this platform has everything you need to sell online.\n*   **Social media ads and scheduling:**\u00a0Although MailerLite has basic Facebook integrations, it doesn\u2019t offer ads or organic posting. Constant Contact supports paid Facebook and Instagram ads and lets you schedule organic social media posts. This feature is\u00a0ideal for marketers who manage both email and social media.\n*   **Better website builder:**\u00a0MailerLite has a website builder, but you have to pay extra for a website with more than five landing pages. In contrast, **Constant Contact lets you build a mobile-responsive site with a blog, analytics, and free hosting**. With this platform, you can create as many landing pages as you need, including shoppable pages and lead generation forms.\n*   **Marketing calendar:**\u00a0To help you keep your email and social media campaigns straight, Constant Contact has a convenient marketing calendar. This visualization lets you create drafts or complete campaigns, and it can help you feel confident that you\u2019ve timed every element perfectly.\n\n[6\\. AWeber \u2013 Offers the Best Support for Marketing Teams](https://www.websiteplanet.com/goto.php?id=2127&lang=en&deep_id=0&deep_name=&btn_name=VendorExternalUrl_2127_post_1855439_280349&post_id=1855439&pageview_id=0&direct_link=&type=post&amp=0)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**With its large email template library and extensive app integration options, AWeber has much more functionality than MailerLite.**\u00a0AWeber also has a built-in e-commerce tool and offers more landing pages with every pricing tier. If you want to connect your marketing apps to your email service or if you need e-commerce tools, AWeber is a great option.\n\nAlthough both MailerLite and AWeber have free plans, I find the latter superior. **AWeber\u2019s free plan\u00a0supports up to 500 subscribers and includes hundreds of email templates, an e-commerce solution, and as many landing pages as you need to create.** By going with AWeber, you could sell products and grow your list at no cost.\n\nAll AWeber plans allow unlimited users and offer some of the most accessible customer support available anywhere, making this plan a great choice for beginners. But if you\u2019re an experienced marketer or if your team has more complex marketing needs, I would recommend a platform like [GetResponse](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/getresponse/) or [ActiveCampaign](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/activecampaign/) instead.\n\n### **AWeber Features**\n\n![Image 6: AWeber landing page template gallery](https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6-best-mailerlite-alternatives-anna-sonnenberg-6.png)\n\nAWeber has landing page templates for downloads, sales, coupons, and more\n\nWith AWeber, you get:\n\n*   **Massive selection of email templates:**\u00a0**With over 700 responsive templates, AWeber has one of the largest selection**s;\u00a0more than 10 times what MailerLite offers. The AWeber template library has categories for industries like home, real estate, retail, and travel so you can quickly find the right design for your business.\n*   **Thousands of stock images:**\u00a0**MailerLite may not offer stock photos, but AWeber has over 6,000** options. You can browse categories like arts and entertainment or business and finance to find eye-catching images, and you can add them to your emails with a single click.\n*   **Unlimited landing pages:** Each AWeber plan, including the free version, provides you with unlimited landing pages. AWeber offers approximately two dozen templates to select from and an array of customization options through the drag-and-drop editor, making it simple for you to create professional landing pages. In contrast, MailerLite grants you five landing pages per plan and necessitates an extra fee for access to unlimited landing pages.\n*   **Comprehensive support:** AWeber provides live chat, email, and phone support with every plan\u00a0\u2013 one of many reasons it scored highly in our [AWeber review](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/aweber/).\u00a0Since support is available 24/7, you can get help resolving issues no matter when you work. MailerLite offers email support only with its free plan and includes both chat and email with its premium plans. Phone support isn\u2019t available for MailerLite.\n\nWhen MailerLite Isn\u2019t for You\n-----------------------------\n\nMailerLite offers email marketing essentials like responsive templates, a drag-and-drop editor, A/B testing, and audience segmentation. It also has a free plan that lets you send up to 12,000 emails per month. **But with its limited automations, lack of built-in tools, and a short list of app integrations, MailerLite isn\u2019t the best option for every marketer.**\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a MailerLite alternative with more email templates and app integrations, go with **Benchmark** or **AWeber**, which both have hundreds of options. **To automate your marketing efforts, consider GetResponse or ActiveCampaign, which have the most powerful marketing automations.**\n\nFor native tools, **go with Constant Contact**, which serves as a complete marketing suite. **If you want an email marketing service for less, consider Sendinblue\u2019s generous free plan, which provides the widest range of marketing tools at no cost.**\u00a0To browse other MailerLite competitors, look at our list of the [top email marketing services in 2024](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/).\n\nFAQ\n\n\n-----\n\n### Is MailerLite better than Mailchimp?\n\nMailerLite is better than Mailchimp, whether you choose a free plan or a paid account. With a free MailerLite plan, you\u2019ll be offered dozens more responsive email templates and marketing integrations. With a paid plan, [MailerLite offers advanced features](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/mailerlite/) that Mailchimp doesn\u2019t have, including a dedicated IP that offers more control over deliverability.\n\n### How much does MailerLite cost?\n\nMailerLite has a free plan, so you can use this service at no cost. If you want to send unlimited emails or advanced features, choose a paid plan instead. MailerLite\u2019s premium plans start at $10.00 per month for up to 1,000 subscribers. Pricing increases based on the size of your subscriber list.\n\n### How do I delete my MailerLite account?\n\nYou can delete your MailerLite account from the login screen. First, enter your username and password. Then locate the account you want to delete and click the gear icon to access settings. Select \u201cDelete account\u201d to complete the process. If other users still need access to the account, click \u201cRemove me from this account\u201d instead.

      "content": "Mailerlite is a popular option for beginners and users who don\u2019t want to break the bank. However, if you want more advanced capabilities to scale your business, it may be time to consider a few great **MailerLite alternatives**.\n\nToday, we\u2019ll focus on some of the best competitors you can choose to make your business thrive.

Assess the scalability of each alternative and how well the platform can accommodate your business's growth. Can you easily add subscribers without incurring exorbitant costs? Does the platform [include automation](https://www.marketermilk.com/blog/best-email-automation-platforms) to lighten your workload as you scale?\n\nYou might as well think best-case scenario here; if you set up your newsletter right, it\u2019ll grow, and that\u2019s a good problem to have.\n\n### Ease of use\n\nHow do you like the user interface and overall user experience? A user-friendly platform can save time and resources, especially if you have team members with varying levels of technical expertise.

Consider factors such as subscription plans, pricing tiers, and any additional costs.

Responsive, reliable support is crucial for addressing onboarding questions, delivering newsletters according to schedule, and preventing downtime.\n\n### Customization options\n\nConsider the level of customization each alternative offers. Does it allow you to personalize emails, add your logo and colors, and create visually stunning designs? The ability to tailor email campaigns to your needs and style can mean the difference between design-rich newsletters reflecting your brand and generic emails that might get left unread.\n\n### Analytics and reporting\n\nIf you can measure it, you can improve it. Evaluate the analytics and reporting features of MailerLite alternatives to ensure access to valuable insights into campaign performance, subscriber behavior, and areas for improvement.\n\n### User reviews\n\nWhat\u2019s the word on the street about each platform?
