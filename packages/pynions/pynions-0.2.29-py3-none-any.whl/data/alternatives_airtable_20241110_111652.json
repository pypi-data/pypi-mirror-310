      "title": "The 6 best Airtable alternatives in 2024",
      "content": "[Airtable](https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-airtable/) is a great app. If it's the right fit for your team, it's probably worth using, and you don't need to keep reading to find an alternative. But if it's not a perfect fit, and you're looking for something else that has Airtable's database features, powerful automations, and built-in project management\u2014but is just a little bit different for one reason or another\u2014then you've come to the right place.\n\nThere are a handful of direct competitors to Airtable, but having tested all of them for this article, I can confidently say that no app quite does Airtable's full feature set as well as Airtable does. But Airtable isn't flawless: it's pretty expensive, it can be tricky to figure out, and if you're not making the most out of its app building, data handling, and automation features, it might just be the wrong tool for your team. It also might lack some key feature you're looking for.\n\nBecause Airtable has such a broad feature set and can be configured to do almost anything, there are lots of apps out there that can claim to be an alternative, at least in some ways. I tested almost 40 of them for this list, and while the number of direct competitors is pretty small, there are some great apps that offer a lot of what Airtable does but with a different emphasis, a few extra features, or at a cheaper price. Here are my six favorites.\n\nThe best Airtable alternatives\n------------------------------\n\n*   [Stackby](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-alternatives/#stackby) for an affordable and very Airtable-like alternative\n    \n*   [Google Sheets](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-alternatives/#google-sheets) for a free Airtable alternative\n    \n*   [Spreadsheet.com](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-alternatives/#spreadsheet-com) for something more like a spreadsheet\n    \n*   [Zapier Tables](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-alternatives/#zapier-tables) for automation\n    \n*   [ClickUp](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-alternatives/#clickup) for project management\n    \n*   [Coda](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-alternatives/#coda) for adding documents\n    \n\nWhat makes the best Airtable alternative?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n##### How we evaluate and test apps\n\nOur best apps roundups are written by humans who've spent much of their careers using, testing, and writing about software. Unless explicitly stated, we spend dozens of hours researching and testing apps, using each app as it's intended to be used and evaluating it against the criteria we set for the category. We're never paid for placement in our articles from any app or for links to any site\u2014we value the trust readers put in us to offer authentic evaluations of the categories and apps we review. For more details on our process, read the full rundown of [how we select apps to feature on the Zapier blog](https://zapier.com/blog/selecting-apps/).\n\nFor an app to be a viable Airtable alternative, it has to offer features that allow you to do some (and ideally most) of the things that Airtable does. The features don't have to be identical or work in the exact same way, but the end result should be that you can use the apps somewhat interchangeably.\n\nSure, Airtable might be better for some uses, and my picks here will be better for others, but I was still looking for apps that met a few key criteria:\n\n*   **Database-like features**. At its core, Airtable is a lightweight, user-friendly database. If you can't code your own app using SQL, you can use an Airtable base to build much the same kind of tool. For me, some kind of fairly powerful data handling features were an absolute non-negotiable. Anything short of a very powerful spreadsheet implementation just isn't going to allow you to store and use data like Airtable can.\n    \n*   **Powerful automations**. Airtable is known for its integrations, automations, and ability to [build custom apps](https://zapier.com/blog/simple-database-app-builders/) (or at least app-like [internal tools](https://zapier.com/blog/best-internal-tool-builder/)). Any service that can't pull information from your CRM or a web form, or automatically update your stored data and display it nicely based on some criteria you set, is really missing a key part of what makes Airtable so useful.\n    \n*   **Versatility**. Airtable can be used to build almost any kind of tool you want. I use an Airtable base to keep track of my article pitches and the publications and editors I want to send them to. Zapier uses it for its editorial calendar, while [Taylor's Guitars uses it to run their marketing efforts](https://www.airtable.com/customer-stories/customer-story-taylor-guitars), and an international retail group [uses it to manage its product development](https://www.airtable.com/customer-stories/Kamal-osman-jamjoom). If some off-the-shelf app doesn't meet your needs, odds are you can build something that does using Airtable. While not every app on this list is quite as customizable, I was still looking for versatile, flexible tools that could be put to a variety of uses depending on your needs.\n    \n*   **Ease of use**. For all that power, once you wrap your head around the [basics of databases](https://zapier.com/blog/database-vs-spreadsheet/), Airtable is surprisingly user-friendly. The interface is excellent, it's got great templates, and the help docs are really comprehensive. For an app to make this list, it needed to be roughly as easy to use as Airtable. A bit of complexity is fine if the help docs are good, but I'm not going to recommend tools that allow you to configure your own local SQL database.\n    \n*   **Some kind of collaboration**. While Airtable can be used solo, it's mostly an app for coordinating data between teams. For an app to make this list, it needed to offer some kind of sharing or collaboration, too. It didn't quite need to be at Airtable's enterprise level, but a team of five or 10 should be able to collaborate and work together using it.\n    \n\nAnd, of course, I was also looking for some kind of standout reason to use any of these apps over Airtable. It bears repeating: Airtable is a great tool that I use all the time. If you're looking for another app, it's presumably because Airtable isn't doing something you need it to\u2014so I put 40-odd possible Airtable alternatives through their paces to find the best of them.\n\nI've been testing and writing about software for more than a decade, so I have a solid handle on how to assess apps like this. Over the course of about a week, I tried each app and used it to do some of the things I (and others) normally use Airtable for. This included managing schedules, planning workouts, and building a CRM. From that testing, I was able to see which apps really were Airtable alternatives\u2014and which of those were the best.\n\nAnd now, on to the list.\n\nThe best Airtable alternatives at a glance\n------------------------------------------\n\n|  | **Best for**\n | **Pricing**\n\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [**Stackby**](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-alternatives/#stackby)\n\n | A direct alternative that's affordable\n\n | Free for 1,500 rows per Stack; from $4/user/month for 3,500 rows per Stack and more features\n\n |\n| [**Google Sheets**](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-alternatives/#google-sheets)\n\n | A free option\n\n | 100% free\n\n |\n| [**Spreadsheet.com**](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-alternatives/#spreadsheet-com)\n\n | A spreadsheet-style alternative\n\n | Free for 1 creator, 5 workbooks with up to 1,500 rows, and 100 automation actions per month; from $7/creator/month for unlimited workbooks with up to 5,000 rows and 250 automation actions per month\n\n |\n| [**Zapier Tables**](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-alternatives/#zapier-tables)\n\n | Automation\n\n | Free for Tables Basic; $20/month for Premium with 20 tables and 100,000 records per base; $100/ for Advanced, with 50 tables and 500,000 records per base\n\n |\n| [**ClickUp**](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-alternatives/#clickup)\n\n | Project management\n\n | Free for 5 spaces, 100MB of storage, and limited automations; from $7/user/month for unlimited spaces and storage and 1,000 automation executions\n\n |\n| [**Coda**](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-alternatives/#coda)\n\n | A document-based alternative\n\n | Free for unlimited unshared docs with limited automations and integrations; from $10/month/doc maker for unlimited docs, more automations and integrations, and unlimited table syncing between docs\n\n |\n\n* * *\n\nBest affordable Airtable alternative\n------------------------------------\n\n### [Stackby](https://stackby.com/) (Web, iOS, Android)\n\n![Image 1: Stackby, our pick for the best Airtable alternative that's a direct competitor and affordable](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/1Ef0Oq9t05RSMN68dMGTtX/c642c36e56f9deaf6f3637b4f6c59eb0/image4.png?w=1400)\n\n**Stackby pros:**\n\n*   For many people, Stackby and Airtable are functionally identical\n    \n*   Stackby is a lot more affordable than Airtable\n    \n\n**Stackby cons:**\n\n*   Lacks polish\n    \n\nStackby is a pretty direct replacement for Airtable. Of course, there are dozens of differences. There are little things, like databases being called Stacks instead of bases. Then there are larger things, like the interface builder being replaced with a series of sidebar apps that can do things like summarize the information in your databases or show charts. And finally, the expected things, like buttons being in different places. There are even a few bonus features, like Stackby's ability to directly connect other services to columns.\n\nBut really, these differences don't massively change the fact that both apps are databases with nice user interfaces. Both tools aim to fill much the same role in your organization\u2014and both succeed.\n\nSome people will prefer Airtable or Stackby based on all the small differences (and they're both worth trying if you're looking for a database tool). So the most compelling reason to go with Stackby is pretty simple: it can be significantly cheaper. Airtable's free plan limits you to 1,000 records per month and limited automations. After that, you have to jump up to the $20/user/month (billed annually) Team plan to get up to 50,000 records per base and the $45/user/month plan (billed annually) if you want all of Airtable's features.\n\nStackby's free plan gets you 1,500 rows per stack, but it has more plans for smaller users. Billed annually, Personal is $4/user/month for 3,500 rows per stack, Economy is $8/user/month for 7,000 rows per stack, and even Business is only $16/user/month for 50,000 rows per stack and Stackby's full feature set. Yep, Stackby's most expensive paid plan costs less than Airtable's cheapest ones.\n\nHaving said that, Stackby is a less mature tool than Airtable, and it shows in a few places. The overall experience was a bit slower, and I encountered a few bugs\u2014for example, the sidebar apps I mentioned earlier wouldn't add or load a few times when I was testing them. I also found Stackby's interface to be less polished and its automation features a bit less intuitive to use, though that might just be because I'm a regular Airtable user.\n\nLike Airtable, [Stackby integrates with Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/stackby/integrations), so you can do things like automatically add data to it from all the other apps in your tech stack. Here are some examples to get you started.\n\n**Stackby price:** Free for 1,500 rows per Stack; from $4/user/month (billed annually) for Personal with 3,500 rows per Stack and more features.\n\n[SmartSuite](https://www.smartsuite.com/) is another app that's pretty similar to Airtable, but I found Stackby offered a better user experience. It's still worth checking out, though.\n\nBest free Airtable alternative\n------------------------------\n\n### [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) (Web, iOS, Android)\n\n![Image 2: Google Sheets, our pick for the best free Airtable alternative](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/5nriZHXuXZJM08Mwgve5MP/3e63c286c64387d74b7b635c8c14b3a4/image1.png?w=1400)\n\n**Google Sheets pros:**\n\n*   Completely free\n    \n*   Familiar interface\n    \n\n**Google Sheets cons:**\n\n*   It's similar enough to Airtable to be used to do many of the same things, but still a different style of app (spreadsheet, not database)\n    \n\nIn Zapier's head-to-head look at [Airtable vs. Google Sheets](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-vs-google-sheets/), it says comparing Google Sheets and Airtable is a lemons-to-oranges situation\u2014kind of the same thing, but not really. So what's Google Sheets doing on this list?\n\nWell, [Google Sheets](https://zapier.com/blog/google-sheets-tutorial/) has one huge thing going for it: it's free. You can work with huge quantities of data and collaborate with dozens of people, all without entering a single credit card number. And for all that, you can use it to build many of the same kinds of tools and workflows as you can with Airtable.\n\nBecause it's a spreadsheet app and not a database, sorting and working with data requires a touch more effort, but it's still possible. It has great integrations and automations and even has its own programmable macro system. You'll probably have to do some Googling to find instructions if you really want to push Sheets to its limits, but it's incredible how much you can do with it.\n\nBeyond that, Sheets obviously integrates with the rest of Google's ecosystem, which you may already be using. It can also be used with [Google AppSheet](https://about.appsheet.com/pricing/) (which is free if you have fewer than 10 users) to build more complex apps, like project trackers, incident report management systems, and scheduling tools.\n\nAnd it also [integrates with Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/google-sheets/integrations), so you can do things like save email attachments to a Sheet, or even send emails when something gets updated. Learn more about [how to automate Google Sheets](https://zapier.com/blog/automate-google-sheets/), or get started with one of these pre-made workflows.\n\n**Google Sheets price:** Free\n\nIf you already use another [spreadsheet app](https://zapier.com/blog/best-spreadsheet-excel-alternative/) like Microsoft Excel or Zoho Sheet, that will probably work almost as well.\n\nBest Airtable alternative that's more like a spreadsheet\u00a0\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n### [Spreadsheet.com](https://www.spreadsheet.com/) (Web)\n\n![Image 3: Spreadsheet.com, our pick for an Airtable alternative that's more like a spreadsheet](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/2VsSckCsUBBzAExoTCrQFx/a21af9e73b346cf55a03c1f941308973/image3.png?w=1400)\n\n**Spreadsheet.com pros:**\n\n*   Many of Airtable's best features with a spreadsheet spin\n    \n*   Solid free plan to get started with\n    \n\n**Spreadsheet.com cons:**\n\n*   Lots of teams will quickly outgrow the more affordable plans\n    \n\nSometimes you want a database, but sometimes you want a spreadsheet. The simplest way to understand the difference is that in a database like Airtable, you can only operate on information by column. Every row has the same fixed structure with the same variables. It's great for keeping data strictly organized, but it gives up a lot of flexibility.\n\nWith a spreadsheet, you can more easily do what you want. Instead of having to work with data by column, you can operate on information by cell. It doesn't matter if the label at the top of a column says _Date_; if you want to, you can throw a formula into any row and have it calculate your net profit for the quarter.\n\nSpreadsheet.com was the best of the spreadsheet-style Airtable competitors I tested. It has a lot of the high-level features that Airtable does, like great integrations and automations, easy collaboration, and the ability to build apps and interfaces. But instead of using a database to handle your data, it uses a spreadsheet.\n\nThis means that you can use Spreadsheet.com to build the same kind of tools, store the same kind of information, and manage the same kind of projects as Airtable, but with something that feels more similar to Excel or whatever spreadsheet app you're used to. If that sounds like what you're looking for, it's the tool to look at.\n\n[Spreadsheet.com also integrates with Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/spreadsheetcom/integrations), so you can connect it to thousands of other apps. Here are a couple of examples to give you an idea.\n\n**Spreadsheet.com price:** Free for 1 creator, 5 workbooks with up to 1,500 rows, and 100 automation actions per month; from $7/creator/month (billed annually) for unlimited workbooks with up to 5,000 rows and 250 automation actions per month.\n\n[Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/) is another similar tool, though it feels more like a project management app (and it's marketed that way, too). Check it out if that's what you're looking for.\n\nThe best Airtable alternative for automation\n--------------------------------------------\n\n### [Zapier Tables](https://zapier.com/tables) (Web)\n\n![Image 4: Zapier Tables, our pick for the best Airtable alternative for automation](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/2155IwuolfvD8tdvogdiBv/e7534254530524a298eddf0164149fcc/23600f224b2ea1cbed2865f0ed80865f.png?w=1400)\n\nIf you're looking for a database that can pull and send data from thousands of sources automatically\u2014or at the click of a button\u2014then [Zapier Tables](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-tables-guide/) is where to start. (And yes, this is the Zapier blog, so try it out yourself to see why it's worthy of inclusion here.)\n\nAs a product built into Zapier, there are a couple of downsides. It's not quite as robust as Airtable, at least not for everything. Zapier Tables can handle fewer data types, for example, and there are fewer templates and ways to see your data. Similarly, while you can link records between tables using Zaps, it's more complicated than using multiple tables in the same base as you would with Airtable.\n\nBut simplicity is one of the benefits here. Everything is streamlined, without losing out on the power of being able to connect your database with 6,000+ other apps.\n\nWhile Zapier has a free plan, you're limited to 100 tasks per month. If you want to automate more, you'll need at least the starter plan, at $19.99/month (billed annually), and if you want to collaborate with other users, then you need a Team plan, at $69/month (billed annually). On top of that, you're likely to also need Tables Premium (to get more than 10 tables), and Interfaces Premium (to build out custom apps); they each cost an extra $20/month.\n\nAll in all, if you're already using Zapier or know you're really going to be automating data collection and management from multiple different sources, then Tables is absolutely worth a look. Start with one of these pre-built templates to get a feel for how it works.\n\n![Image 5: Leads in a hub for sending to a CRM, emailing, and more all in Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F0sppvm4cmdq7%2FN2IMnCldMmD32kaQx8pe3%2F1c8fa61bf26931f85658fd3d95828a49%2FThumbnail_3__5_.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nLead Hub Template\n\nCreate a lead hub for your team or clients to review, contact, and add leads to their CRM.\n\n![Image 6: Approval Request Template Preview](https://zapier.com/blog/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F0sppvm4cmdq7%2F1zF3nm4bgP218v0xtEKC0f%2F6b047a9af4d5566ca8724b8e22ccbd3d%2FThumbnail_8.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nApproval Request Template\n\nEasily approve or reject requests and send automatic messages to the requester.\n\n**Zapier Tables pricing:** Free for Tables Basic; $20/month for Premium with 20 tables and 100,000 records per base; $100/month for Advanced, with 50 tables and 500,000 records per base\n\nBest Airtable alternative for project management\n------------------------------------------------\n\n### [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/) (Web, iOS, Android)\n\n![Image 7: ClickUp, our pick for the best Airtable alternative for project management](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/5S6pJBj1tKVbGMReTH7nLk/467d1ac868eafbccda4742c11abc9e2d/image2.png?w=1400)\n\n**ClickUp pros:**\n\n*   ClickUp's tables are usable as a database, once you get over every row being referred to as a task\n    \n\n**ClickUp cons:**\n\n*   Still primarily a project management tool; if you really want a database app, it isn't the right pick\n    \n\nDespite its origins as a database tool, Airtable has become an incredibly popular project management app. Depending on how you set it up, it can be used to manage your team's tasks and goals, keep track of your project roadmaps, store important files and assets, and handle almost every aspect of any given project.\n\nWith that said, it doesn't have the full project management features of a dedicated app. If you want things like time tracking, team chat, more ways to view your projects, and, really, just an overall focus on project management, then you need an app like ClickUp.\n\nLike Coda, ClickUp isn't a like-for-like Airtable competitor, but it has a robust tables feature that you can do enough with that there's a lot of overlap. Projects can be viewed as both a table and a list, which allow you to add database-like columns to each task. It's a bit odd that each row is called a task regardless of whether it's actually a job for someone to do, contact details for a potential customer, or anything else\u2014but it's not as if it stops you using the app. Despite the odd naming conventions, you can automate the various different fields for each task, perform database-like operations, and generally build a lot of the tools you can with Airtable\u2014especially if you use one of the many built-in templates to give you a head start.\n\nIf you primarily want a project management app but also need a tool that can be used to build a CRM or get simple asset sharing set up, ClickUp is well worth a look. If your team heavily relies on Airtable, it's unlikely to be a replacement, but if you only use Airtable for a handful of features, you can probably recreate most of what you need.\n\n[ClickUp also integrates with Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/clickup/integrations/), so you can create tasks from the other apps you use most. Learn more about [how to automate ClickUp](https://zapier.com/blog/automate-clickup/), or get started with one of these pre-made templates.\n\n**ClickUp price:** Free for 5 spaces, 100MB of storage, and limited automations; from $7/user/month (billed annually) for unlimited spaces and storage and 1,000 automations executions.\n\n[monday.com](https://monday.com/) is a similar project management app that's worth a look. ClickUp just felt closer to Airtable as I was testing both of them. To learn more about monday.com, take a look at Zapier's comparison: [ClickUp vs. monday](https://zapier.com/blog/clickup-vs-monday/).\n\nBest document-based Airtable alternative\u00a0\n-----------------------------------------\n\n### [Coda](https://coda.io/) (Web, iOS, Android)\n\n![Image 8: Coda, our pick for a document-based Airtable alternative](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/5mbNVpAI2dZfoQtKUDGFR0/e980a1100a9e1764c595227fb354f281/image5.png?w=1400)\n\n**Coda pros:**\n\n*   If you mostly want a document-based app with the option to have a database or two, Coda's tables work great\n    \n\n**Coda cons:**\n\n*   If you really want a database-based app, it's not the option to choose\n    \n\nAirtable is great if you want to run your business and plan everything through table-like databases. But even if you're an Airtable superuser, you'll most likely need another document app for handling things like meeting notes, product briefs, and other text- or image-heavy documents. But what if you could get by with just one app? That's where Coda comes in.\n\nCoda is a collaborative project management app that feels pretty similar to Airtable, except it relies on documents instead of bases to organize everything. But as part of any doc, you can add a surprisingly robust table that works similarly to Airtable's bases. Columns can reference other tables in different documents, you can add information using integrations with Zapier and other apps, and you can perform complex calculations. On higher plans, tables and action buttons can also sync automatically between docs. I'd say that like for like, you can probably do 80% of what you can with Airtable with Coda's tables, even if setting things up is a touch less intuitive\u2014and you might need to be on a higher plan to get all the features you need.\n\nOf course, 80% is only good if you're also looking for the rest of what Coda offers: an [all-in-one collaborative workspace](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/) for your team. It's a good choice if you mostly work with documents but want to occasionally manage some aspect of a project using a database. But if you're looking for a database-first app, it's not the best choice.\n\n[Coda integrates with Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/coda/integrations), so you can add rows to a table directly from all the other apps you use. Learn more about [how to automate Coda](https://zapier.com/blog/automate-coda/), or get started with one of these pre-made workflows.\n\n**Coda price:** Free for unlimited unshared docs with limited automations and integrations; from $10/month/doc maker (billed annually) for unlimited docs, more automations and integrations, and unlimited table syncing between docs.\n\n[Notion](https://zapier.com/blog/organize-your-life-with-notion/) is a similar app with tables that can work kind of like databases, but its databases aren't as advanced. For a full rundown of how it stacks up to Airtable, check out the head-to-head: [Notion vs. Coda](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-vs-notion/).\n\nOther possible Airtable alternatives\n------------------------------------\n\nWith so many possible apps you can use as an alternative for at least some of what Airtable offers, there are plenty of options that didn't make this list. Sometimes it was because an app was just plain bad, but other times, it was because it just didn't tick all the boxes I was looking for. Here are a handful of the latter\u2014Airtable alternatives that are worth checking out but didn't quite make the cut.\n\n*   [SmartSuite](https://www.smartsuite.com/), like Stackby, is another direct competitor to Airtable. I ran into a few bugs and didn't like the overall experience as much, but it's another affordable option that can be worth looking at.\n    \n*   [Fibery](https://fibery.io/) is a bit like a hybrid between Airtable and Notion, with some more task management features thrown in. If you really want one app that does everything, give it a look.\n    \n*   [Baserow](https://baserow.io/) is an open source Airtable alternative. It's not quite as feature-filled, but it can be a viable option for some teams. And if you're prepared to host it yourself, it can be super affordable.\n    \n*   For the list above, in most categories, I went for the app that _felt_ the most like Airtable. But [Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), and [monday.com](https://monday.com/) are all great apps that came super close to making the list. Spreadsheet.com, Coda, and ClickUp just gave me more Airtable-y vibes.\n    \n*   While Airtable is a no-code database tool that allows you to build apps for you and your team, [Xano](https://www.xano.com/) is a no-code database tool that allows you to build with other no-code tools. If that's actually what you're looking for, check it out.\n    \n\n**Related reading:**\n\n*   [Airtable automation ideas](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-automations/)\n    \n*   [Create a lead management table powered by AI with Zapier Tables](https://zapier.com/blog/create-lead-management-table-with-zapier-tables/)\n    \n*   [How to create an onboarding process with Zapier Tables](https://zapier.com/blog/create-an-onboarding-process-with-zapier-tables/)\n    \n*   [Smartsheet vs. Airtable: Which is best?](https://zapier.com/blog/smartsheet-vs-airtable)\n    \n*   [Airtable vs. Trello: Which should you use?](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-vs-trello)\n    \n*   [Airtable vs. Asana: Which is right for you?](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-vs-asana)"

      "content": "You\u2019ve probably worked with Airtable\u2014it\u2019s the kind of tool that makes organizing data feel as simple as building a spreadsheet. But, if you\u2019ve ever hit Airtable\u2019s limits, you know what I mean. Maybe you\u2019ve outgrown its capabilities, or maybe the cost is creeping up with every added record. Whatever the reason, you\u2019re here because you\u2019re looking for a solid alternative.\n\nWe've been in your shoes, and after testing countless platforms, we\u2019re here to offer real insights on the best Airtable alternatives out there in 2024. We\u2019ve gone beyond surface-level comparisons and truly put these tools to the test, including our very own Tadabase.\n\nTadabase: A Powerful Airtable Alternative\n-----------------------------------------\n\nWhy start with Tadabase? Well, it's more than just a competitor\u2014Tadabase was built from the ground up by people who needed a better solution. And when you build something for yourself, you make sure it works.\n\n![Image 1](https://d10w0xb1xxwn2r.cloudfront.net/2ejlZ5BNo9/1710404244-Fields.webp)\n\n#### **What Sets Tadabase Apart?**\n\n*   **Powerful Database Functionality**: Imagine Airtable on steroids. Tadabase doesn\u2019t just offer a spreadsheet-like interface; it offers the flexibility to create highly customized applications. From project management to complex enterprise databases, it can handle it all.\n    \n*   **Automation to Streamline Your Workflows**: Airtable\u2019s automations are nice, but Tadabase takes it further. Think of it like upgrading from a simple timer to a smart home system\u2014you can automate almost any task and integrate with the tools you already use, like Zapier, without feeling boxed in.\n    \n*   **Deep Integrations**: Speaking of integrations, Tadabase connects seamlessly with external apps, using tools like our proprietary Pipes and Databridge. We use these features ourselves, so we know exactly how much time and headache they can save you.\n    \n\n**Our Experience**: Since Tadabase is our creation, we\u2019ve lived and breathed it daily. We know the ins and outs because we\u2019ve built it to solve real problems. So when we tell you it\u2019s powerful enough to scale with your business, you can trust we\u2019re not just blowing smoke\u2014we\u2019ve tested and used it ourselves in every way possible.\n\n![Image 2](https://d10w0xb1xxwn2r.cloudfront.net/2ejlZ5BNo9/1711043455-download.png)\n\nAirtable's Strengths and Weaknesses: Why Seek an Alternative?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAirtable is popular for good reason. It's simple, clean, and you don\u2019t need to be a database expert to make it work. It\u2019s a blend of a spreadsheet and database\u2014great for small teams or individual projects.\n\nBut as good as Airtable is, it\u2019s not perfect. If you\u2019ve ever needed more records or advanced features, you\u2019ve probably noticed the price hikes. That\u2019s often where users feel the pinch. It can also feel limiting when you need more customization or want to automate deeper workflows. That\u2019s where other platforms, like Tadabase, start to shine.\n\n10 Best Airtable Alternatives (We\u2019ve Tested Them All)\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 1\\.

Every feature has been put to the test in our own operations, ensuring it meets the high standards we set for ourselves and our users. In short, we don't just talk the talk; we walk the walk with Tadabase at the core of our business.\n\n#### 2\\. [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/)\u00a0![Image 10](blob:https://tadabase.io/4cb7fe9798e56963a735027ab05dcc6a)\n\n![Image 11](https://clickup.com/assets/home-test/enhance.png)\n\n**Best For**: Teams looking for a versatile project management tool with a wide range of features.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n![Image 12](https://d10w0xb1xxwn2r.cloudfront.net/2ejlZ5BNo9/1711060483-wired-gradient-24-approved-checked.gif) Multiple views, including List, Board, Calendar, and Gantt.\n\n![Image 13](https://d10w0xb1xxwn2r.cloudfront.net/2ejlZ5BNo9/1711060483-wired-gradient-24-approved-checked.gif) Powerful automation and integrations.\n\n![Image 14](https://d10w0xb1xxwn2r.cloudfront.net/2ejlZ5BNo9/1711060483-wired-gradient-24-approved-checked.gif) User-friendly interface.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n![Image 15](https://d10w0xb1xxwn2r.cloudfront.net/2ejlZ5BNo9/1711060679-wired-gradient-25-error-cross.gif) Can be overwhelming with many features.\n\n**Pricing**: Free plan available; paid plans start at $5/user/month.\n\nClickUp is a versatile platform that caters to various project management needs. It's known for its flexibility, allowing teams to customize views, workflows, and tasks to fit their specific requirements. ClickUp's strength lies in its ability to consolidate multiple tools into one, reducing the need for juggling different applications. Whether you're managing a marketing campaign, software development, or creative projects, ClickUp provides the features and integrations to keep everything organized and on track.\n\n_Our Experience_: We've tried ClickUp for different projects and found it to be an all-in-one solution for task management and collaboration. The platform's adaptability stood out to us, as we could tailor it to our diverse needs. However, we noticed that the abundance of features might be overwhelming for new users, so there's a bit of a learning curve involved.\n\n#### 3\\. [Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/)\u00a0![Image 16](blob:https://tadabase.io/e7f3d3c3600f117ebf0094104cefa5b0)\n\n![Image 17](https://www.smartsheet.com/sites/default/files/2023-07/ppc-header-views-collage_5.png)\n\n**Best For**: Organizations that prefer a spreadsheet-like interface with enhanced project management capabilities.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n![Image 18](https://d10w0xb1xxwn2r.cloudfront.net/2ejlZ5BNo9/1711060483-wired-gradient-24-approved-checked.gif) Familiar interface for spreadsheet users.\n\n![Image 19](https://d10w0xb1xxwn2r.cloudfront.net/2ejlZ5BNo9/1711060483-wired-gradient-24-approved-checked.gif) Robust project management tools.\n\n![Image 20](https://d10w0xb1xxwn2r.cloudfront.net/2ejlZ5BNo9/1711060483-wired-gradient-24-approved-checked.gif) Good integration with other business tools.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n![Image 21](https://d10w0xb1xxwn2r.cloudfront.net/2ejlZ5BNo9/1711060679-wired-gradient-25-error-cross.gif) Can be expensive for larger teams.\n\n**Pricing**: Plans start at $7/user/month.\n\nSmartsheet is a powerful tool that combines the familiarity of a spreadsheet with the capabilities of a project management system. It's ideal for businesses that are used to working with Excel but need more functionality, such as Gantt charts, automation, and collaboration features. Smartsheet is widely used in industries like construction, marketing, and operations for its ability to handle complex projects and streamline processes.\n\n_Our Experience_: Our team has found Smartsheet to be a great asset for managing projects with a lot of moving parts. The spreadsheet-like interface was easy to adopt, and the additional project management features helped us stay organized. However, we did notice that the cost can add up for larger teams or more advanced needs.\n\n#### 4\\. [Coda](https://coda.io/)\u00a0![Image 22](blob:https://tadabase.io/39f3016bc541331dedef8411b3c4f8e2)\n\n![Image 23](https://sanity-images.imgix.net/production/d90b76eb5bfacfde4377f3f151bb2fe079594062-1440x1024.jpg?w=2000&auto=format%2Ccompress)\n\n**Best For**: Teams wanting a flexible tool that combines documents, spreadsheets, and databases.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n![Image 24](https://d10w0xb1xxwn2r.cloudfront.net/2ejlZ5BNo9/1711060483-wired-gradient-24-approved-checked.gif) Highly customizable and adaptable.\n\n![Image 25](https://d10w0xb1xxwn2r.cloudfront.net/2ejlZ5BNo9/1711060483-wired-gradient-24-approved-checked.gif) Unique approach to data organization.\n\n![Image 26](https://d10w0xb1xxwn2r.cloudfront.net/2ejlZ5BNo9/1711060483-wired-gradient-24-approved-checked.gif) Good collaboration features\n\n**Cons**:\n\n![Image 27](https://d10w0xb1xxwn2r.cloudfront.net/2ejlZ5BNo9/1711060679-wired-gradient-25-error-cross.gif) May require time to learn and set up.\n\n**Pricing**: Free plan available; paid plans start at $10/user/month.\n\nCoda is a unique platform that blends documents, spreadsheets, and databases into one. It's perfect for teams that want a flexible tool to organize their work, from meeting notes and project plans to detailed databases. Coda stands out with its ability to create interactive documents that can include various elements, making it a great choice for businesses looking for a dynamic and adaptable solution.\n\n_Our Experience_: In our testing, Coda impressed us with its versatility and the way it reimagines documents.

      "content": "_Looking for an Airtable alternative?_ You've come to the right place.\n\nFounded in 2012, Airtable is an alternative to one of the most critical, yet often overlooked, software tools upon which much of society relies \u2014 the humble spreadsheet. Airtable's founder, Howie Liu, didn't want to make a better spreadsheet. He wanted to reinvent the spreadsheet entirely. Liu's vision was to empower people to create what are essentially applications without writing a single line of code.\n\nOver the years, Airtable managed to deliver on that ambition quite well, accumulating over 300,000 active customers and being dubbed the \"spreadsheet killer\".\n\nBut Airtable is not without its shortcomings, and there are many reasons why you may be looking for an Airtable alternative:\n\n*   Airtable is powerful, but at the same time highly complex. Many users find it too over-engineered to be used productively ([source](https://www.capterra.com/p/146652/Airtable/reviews/Capterra___1982352/))\n    \n*   Airtable is very flexible and customizable, but it takes a long time to configure it the way you want ([source](https://www.capterra.com/p/146652/Airtable/reviews/3635258/))\n    \n*   It has accumulated numerous features and integrations over the years, but this also made it somewhat clunky ([source](https://www.capterra.com/p/146652/Airtable/reviews/2997246/))\n    \n*   When used collaboratively with multiple people, Airtable can get sluggish ([source](https://www.capterra.com/p/146652/Airtable/reviews/1698946/))\n    \n*   Some users find the interface of Airtable to be unintuitive and cluttered ([source](https://www.capterra.com/p/146652/Airtable/reviews/3778235/))\n    \n\nDoes that sound familiar? Then it might be time to switch to a more user-friendly and fast option \u2013 fortunately, there are many great Airtable competitors to choose from.\n\n![Image 1: Best Airtable alternatives](https://www.nuclino.com/img/alternatives/best-aritable-alternatives.png)\n\nBest Airtable alternatives and competitors\n------------------------------------------\n\nTo make your decision easier, we've evaluated dozens of options and put together a shortlist of the best alternatives to Airtable:\n\n*   [Nuclino](https://www.nuclino.com/alternatives/airtable-alternatives#nuclino)\n*   [Google Sheets](https://www.nuclino.com/alternatives/airtable-alternatives#google-sheets)\n*   [SeaTable](https://www.nuclino.com/alternatives/airtable-alternatives#seatable)\n*   [Asana](https://www.nuclino.com/alternatives/airtable-alternatives#asana)\n*   [nTask](https://www.nuclino.com/alternatives/airtable-alternatives#ntask)\n*   [Trello](https://www.nuclino.com/alternatives/airtable-alternatives#trello)\n*   [Jira](https://www.nuclino.com/alternatives/airtable-alternatives#jira)\n\nAirtable is a highly versatile tool. It's a hybrid between a spreadsheet, a relational database, a project management tool, and a low-code app builder. Depending on how you are using Airtable and why you are looking for an alternative, a different tool might be a better fit for your needs.\n\nWe hope this list helps you learn more about your options and find the Airtable alternative that works for you.\n\n### 1\\. [Nuclino](https://www.nuclino.com/)\n\n![Image 2: Best Airtable alternative Nuclino](https://www.nuclino.com/img/alternatives/best-airtable-alternative-nuclino.png)\n\n[Nuclino](https://www.nuclino.com/) is a lightweight alternative to Airtable. While not as feature-packed, Nuclino focuses on the essentials, such as search, content organization, and collaborative editing. By doing away with the clunky menus and rarely-used options, Nuclino is able to offer a much cleaner and more intuitive interface, minimizing the learning curve for new users.\n\nNuclino is designed like a hybrid of Airtable and Google Docs, bringing together structured data and rich long-form content. Every entry in your database is its own document that can be collaborated on by multiple users in real time. This allows you to add notes, assign tasks, and embed files, consolidating everything you need to get the job done in one place.\n\nComments and mentions make it easy to exchange feedback directly in Nuclino and preserve the context of every decision.\n\n![Image 3: Airtable alternative example](https://www.nuclino.com/img/alternatives/airtable-alternative-nuclino-item-example.png)\n\nLike Airtable, Nuclino allows you to organize your work in many visual ways. In addition to a database-style table, your can visualize your docs and projects in a [Kanban board](https://www.nuclino.com/solutions/kanban-board), a hierarchical list, or an interconnected graph.\n\n![Image 4: Airtable alternative Nuclino board view](https://www.nuclino.com/img/alternatives/best-airtable-alternative-nuclino-board.png)\n\nThis makes Nuclino a great solution for a wide range of use cases, including [knowledge sharing](https://www.nuclino.com/solutions/knowledge-sharing-tools), [employee handbooks](https://www.nuclino.com/articles/employee-handbook-template-examples), [employee onboarding](https://www.nuclino.com/articles/employee-onboarding-process) and [offboarding](https://www.nuclino.com/articles/employee-offboarding), [sprint planning](https://www.nuclino.com/articles/sprint-planning), [process documentation](https://www.nuclino.com/articles/process-documentation), and many more.\n\nPerformance is another notable strength of Nuclino. Every interaction in the app is optimized for speed, from search to editing. All content can be collaborated on by multiple users in real time, with every change automatically preserved in the version history. Markdown commands allow you to quickly format text without taking your hands off the keyboard.\n\n![Image 5: Airtable alternative Nuclino list view](https://www.nuclino.com/img/alternatives/airtable-alternative-nuclino-list.png)\n\n_What users say about Nuclino_:\n\n_\"I use Nuclino to document the projects I work on. It serves as a wiki for the project which helps anyone joining the project at later stages understand what was done during the design process, and why certain decisions were made. It is definitely a big step up from using Google Docs and Google Sheets which gets very messy during the course of a project.\"_\n\n\u2014 [Capterra review](https://www.capterra.com/p/174926/Nuclino/reviews/Capterra___1064155/)\n\n### 2\\. Google Sheets\n\n![Image 6: Airtable alternative Google Sheets](https://www.nuclino.com/img/alternatives/airtable-alternative-google-sheets.png)\n\nAny list of Airtable competitors will be incomplete without Google Sheets, one of the solutions that inspired Airtable a decade ago. If you are primarily using Airtable as a spreadsheet and are looking for a more powerful and flexible tool, Google Sheets may be a valid alternative.\n\nA core strength of Google Sheets lies in its seamless integration with the other apps within Google Workspace. For example, you can easily connect Google Sheets and Slides, embedding your spreadsheets into your presentations and keeping everything in sync.\n\nGoogle Sheets may lack some of the Airtable features, such as Kanban boards or galleries, however, when it comes to its spreadsheet functionality, Sheets offers a lot more flexibility.\n\n_What users say about Google Sheets_:\n\n_\"I love the fact that it integrates with the other Google apps and allows you to link additional files in your spreadsheet document. There is a bit of a learning curve when using Google Sheets, but other than that, it's a great program.\"_\n\n\u2014 [Capterra review](https://www.capterra.com/p/169718/Google-Sheets/reviews/Capterra___3617424/)\n\n### 3\\. SeaTable\n\n![Image 7: Airtable alternative Asana](https://www.nuclino.com/img/alternatives/airtable-alternative-seatable.png)\n\nIf you are looking for an Airtable clone, SeaTable is as close as it gets. The design of SeaTable was heavily inspired by Airtable, to the point where you might barely notice a difference between the two tools.\n\nSeaTable is also a great option for those who would prefer to host their data within the EU. The SeaTable Cloud is hosted in certified German data centers and the platform is fully compliant with GDPR.\n\nIf you want more control over your data, SeaTable has you covered as well. In addition to its shared cloud-hosting service, SeaTable allows you to install it as a self-hosted on-premises solution or as a dedicated system, combining the simplicity of the cloud with the flexibility of a self-hosted system.\n\nNote that like Airtable, SeaTable is also somewhat clunky and complex, so expect a certain learning curve.\n\n_What users say about SeaTable_:\n\n_\"I love SeaTable for democratizing access to relational databases for end-users. It's a great alternative to Airtable and it's going to be great as it matures into a larger product.\"_\n\n\u2014 [Capterra review](https://www.capterra.com/p/207565/SeaTable/reviews/Capterra___2960196/)\n\n### 4\\. Asana\n\n![Image 8: Airtable alternative Asana](https://www.nuclino.com/img/alternatives/airtable-alternative-asana.png)\n\nIf you are using Airtable for project management, Asana can certainly be an alternative worth evaluating. Like Airtable, Asana offers multiple different ways to visualize your data, including a table-style list, a board, a calendar, a timeline that works like a Gantt chart, and more.\n\nWhile Asana may not be a great solution for creating generic databases or working with spreadsheets, its [project management](https://www.nuclino.com/articles/project-management) features are a lot more extensive and robust than those of Airtable. The interface of Asana is also less cluttered and more intuitive, making it easier to get started with the tool.\n\nLooking for more tools similar to Asana? Check out this list of [alternatives to Asana](https://www.nuclino.com/alternatives/asana-alternatives).\n\n_What users say about Asana_:\n\n_\"We switched from Airtable because its project management features were not as robust as we needed. We use Asana daily to keep everyone on track, and I couldn't be happier with the results. Powerful tagging and search functions make it very simple to keep track of our myriad marketing activations and all their associated deliverables. Adding subtasks and including collaborators on tasks makes it very easy to keep track of who needs to do what and by when. Various views like lists, calendars, and kanban boards make it accessible to everyone on the team who thinks and processes information differently.\"_\n\n\u2014 [Capterra review](https://www.capterra.com/p/184581/Asana-PM/reviews/Capterra___2268657/)\n\n### 5\\. nTask\n\n![Image 9: Airtable alternative nTask](https://www.nuclino.com/img/alternatives/airtable-alternative-ntask.png)\n\n[nTask](https://www.ntaskmanager.com/) is another noteworthy option when it comes to Airtable alternatives.\n\nnTask allows you to manage and monitor your work with ease, enabling you to focus on the important stuff. Its drag-and-drop interface makes it easy to prioritize tasks, assign them to team members, and keep track of progress. nTask also provides powerful project management features such as custom views, automated task reminders and due dates, and detailed reporting.\n\n_What users say about nTask_:\n\n_\"It's really a hidden jewel because you can take advantage of most of the features for free, and it offers many of the same functions as larger and much more expensive project management tools.\"_\n\n\u2014 [Capterra review](https://www.capterra.com/p/172292/nTask/reviews/Capterra___1673895/)\n\n### 6\\. Trello\n\n![Image 10: Airtable alternative Trello](https://www.nuclino.com/img/alternatives/airtable-alternative-trello.png)\n\nWhile Trello started out as a simple Kanban tool, it has evolved into a much more flexible, multi-purpose solution. In February of 2022, Trello added its own table view, becoming a strong Airtable competitor.\n\nTrello is still primarily designed to be used as a project management tool and isn't as flexible as Airtable when it comes to labeling and organizing data. However, it makes up for it with a lower learning curve and a simpler interface.\n\nLooking for more tools similar to Trello? Check out this list of [Trello alternatives](https://www.nuclino.com/alternatives/trello-alternative).\n\n_What users say about Trello_:\n\n_\"Airtable has more of a learning curve. Though it is also a great tool, I felt that it was harder to get people on board with using it. Trello is the perfect customizable workflow and task management system for me! I can create a multitude of boards for all of my business and personal needs. Managing these boards and teaching my team or clients how to use this is super easy!\"_\n\n\u2014 [Capterra review](https://www.capterra.com/p/211559/Trello/reviews/Capterra___1650446/)\n\n### 7\\. Jira\n\n![Image 11: Airtable alternative Jira](https://www.nuclino.com/img/alternatives/airtable-alternative-jira.png)\n\nJira is owned by the same company as Trello \u2013 Atlassian. And while both tools can both serve as Airtable alternatives, they are two very different solutions.\n\nJira is, first and foremost, an [Agle project management tool](https://www.nuclino.com/solutions/agile-project-management-tools) for software development teams. While it allows you to organize your projects in a database-style table, similar to Airtable, its feature set is largely geared towards developers.\n\nJira is exceptionally powerful, allowing you to manage the most complex and large-scale projects. At the same time, it's very feature-heavy and comes with a steep learning curve. It can be a great asset for large, experienced software development teams, but for everyone else, it can be confusing and unintuitive.\n\nLooking for more tools similar to Jira? Check out this list of [Jira alternatives](https://www.nuclino.com/alternatives/jira-alternatives).\n\n_What users say about Jira_:\n\n_\"Jira has been an integral part of our software development and project management journey and has just about all the tools you need to successfully manage your project or product offerings. It's more customizable than Trello, Asana, and Airtable, while being user-friendly at the same time.\"_\n\n\u2014 [Capterra review](https://www.capterra.com/p/19319/JIRA/reviews/Capterra___3167444/)\n\nFind the right Airtable alternative for you\n-------------------------------------------\n\nSo what is the best alternative to Airtable? The best choice depends on how you are planning to use it. If you are looking for a faster and more intuitive solution where you can bring all your team's work together, Nuclino can be a great option. If you need a full-featured spreadsheet app, consider Google Sheets. If you want to replace Airtable with a nearly identical but more affordable tool, take a look at SeaTable. And if you are primarily using Airtable for project management and need a more robust alternative, give Trello, Asana, or Jira a try.\n\nWhatever tool you choose, make sure to thoroughly evaluate it, especially if you are planning to use it together with your team."
