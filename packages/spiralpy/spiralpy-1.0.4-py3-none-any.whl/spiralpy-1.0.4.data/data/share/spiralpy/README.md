Python Package for SpiralPy
============================

This is the Python front end for the [SPIRAL project's](http://www.spiralgen.com) Python to
Spiral (**SpiralPy**) interface, which compiles high-level specifications of numerical computations
into hardware-specific optimized code.  It supports a variety of CPU's as well as Nvidia and
AMD GPU's on systems running Linux, Windows, or MacOS.

**SpiralPy** originated under the [DARPA
PAPPA](https://www.darpa.mil/program/performant-automation-of-parallel-program-assembly)
(Performant Automation of Parallel Program Assembly) program.  The program focused on ways
reduce the complexity of building software that takes advantage of the massive parallelism of
advanced high-preformance computing systems.  Further work continued as part of
[FFTX](https://spiral-software.github.io/fftx/introduction.html) under the [Exascale Computing
Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org/).

**SpiralPy**, implemented as a Python package, uses the SPIRAL code generation system to translate
NumPy-based specifications to generated code, then compiles that code into a loadable library.

For details of the structure and API of the package, use the Python `help()` function to view the 
internal documentation of the installed package.  For example:

```python console
>>> import spiralpy
>>> help(spiralpy)
```

See the `examples` (discussed further below) directory for a quick introduction.

*DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A.  Approved for public release.  Distribution is unlimited.*

## Prerequisites

- **Python3** (3.7 or higher)
    - **NumPy**
    - **CuPy** (optional, but needed if targeting GPU's)
- **SPIRAL** (available on GitHub)
    - **spiral-software** https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-software
    - **spiral-package-fftx** https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-package-fftx
    - **spiral-package-simt** https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-package-simt
- **CMake** (3.14 or higher)
- **C Compiler**

With SPIRAL installed you will have CMake, a compatible C compiler, and Python3 for **SpiralPy**.
SPIRAL builds on Linux/Unix with gcc and make, on Windows it builds with Visual Studio.  For
macOS SPIRAL requires version 10.14 (Mojave) or later of macOS, with a compatible version of
Xcode and and Xcode Command Line Tools.


## Installing and Configuring SPIRAL

Clone **spiral-software** to a location on your computer.  For example:
```shell
cd ~/work
git clone https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-software
```
This location is known as *SPIRAL HOME* and you must set an environment variable
**SPIRAL_HOME** to point to this location later.

To install the two spiral packages do the following:
```shell
cd ~/work/spiral-software/namespaces/packages
git clone https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-package-fftx fftx
git clone https://www.github.com/spiral-software/spiral-package-simt simt
```
**NOTE:** The spiral packages must be installed under the directory
**$SPIRAL_HOME/namespaces/packages** and must be placed in directories with the
prefix "spiral-package-" removed. 

Follow the [build
instructions](https://github.com/spiral-software/spiral-software/blob/master/README.md) for
**spiral-software**.


## Installing and Configuring SpiralPy

The easiest method to install **SpiralPy** is to use Python's package manager **pip**, e.g.,
```shell
pip install spiralpy
```

When you install **spiralpy** the modules are installed in your ```site-packages``` location.  You
can determine this location (and your base location) by running this python command:
```shell
python -m site --user-site --user-base
##   Sample output -- On Unix/Linux/MacOS
##   ~/.local:~/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages
##   Windows
##   C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Python;C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python38\site-packages
```

Base location is always output first, the two locations are separated by a ':' (Unix/Linux/MacOS)
or a ';' (Windows).

The examples and other miscellaneous files will be installed at ```share/spiralpy``` under your
base location.  The ```.libs``` folder (see below) is also located here.

If you want to develop, contribute to, or possibly modify **SpiralPy** it may be better to clone
or fork the **SpiralPy** repository, see
[**Contributing**](https://github.com/spiral-software/python-package-spiralpy/blob/main/Contributing.md).
Clone **python-package-spiralpy** to a location on your computer renaming it to **spiralpy**.  For
example:
```shell
cd ~/work/python-packages
git clone https://github.com/spiral-software/python-package-spiralpy spiralpy
```

If you clone or fork the **SpiralPy** repository (vs installing the package) you need to add the
directory that contains it to the environment variable **PYTHONPATH**.  (In the above example that
would be ```~/work/python-packages/spiralpy```).  This allows Python to locate the **spiralpy**
module.

By default, **SpiralPy** puts generated files into a temporary directory under the current working
directory, then deletes that temporary directory after a successful build.  If there is an error
during the build, the temporary directory will remain.  There are two environment variables that
can modify this default behavior: 

+ **SP_WORKDIR** specifies the path to the parent directory of the temporary build directories.
If that specified directory does not exist, **SpiralPy** uses the current directory.

+ **SP_KEEPTEMP** if defined (any value) tells **SpiralPy** to preserve temporary build
directories.

## Exernal Libraries

**SpiralPy** can access libraries built by [**FFTX**](https://github.com/spiral-software/fftx), which have metadata that describes their contents.  **SpiralPy** looks in its ```.libs``` directory for any libraries containing compatible metadata.  It also looks for libraries in directories specified by the **SP_LIBRARY_PATH** environment variable, with the list of directories having the same format as used for the **PATH** variable.


## Try an Example

Open a terminal window in the ```examples``` directory and run this example:

```shell
cd ~/work/python-packages/spiralpy/examples
python run-mddft.py 32
```

The first time you run it, you will see output from the CMake/SPIRAL/C build before the comparison
results, similar to this:
```shell
Generating CUDA
Compiling and linking
Python/C transforms are equivalent, diff = 1.206500728403121e-12
```

After that it will run much faster using the generated library, which is placed in the
<br>
```<base-location>/share/spiralpy/.libs``` directory.

Some of the examples require additional arguments, and some options you can change.  Read through
the examples for better understanding.  If you want to see the generated source files, set the
**SP_KEEPTEMP** environment variable and look in the temporary directories.
