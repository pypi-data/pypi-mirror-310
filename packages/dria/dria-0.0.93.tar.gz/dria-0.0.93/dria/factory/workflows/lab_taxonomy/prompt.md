Generate a hierarchical taxonomy for instruction tuning data based on the following paper abstract. The taxonomy should have 3 main branches: Knowledge, Foundational Skills, and Compositional Skills. Under each branch, create relevant sub-categories and leaf nodes. Include 1-3 example instruction-response pairs for each leaf node.

Use the following structure:
[Branch]
  [Sub-category]
    [Leaf node]
      - Example 1: [Instruction] | [Response]
      - Example 2: [Instruction] | [Response]
      - Example 3: [Instruction] | [Response]
