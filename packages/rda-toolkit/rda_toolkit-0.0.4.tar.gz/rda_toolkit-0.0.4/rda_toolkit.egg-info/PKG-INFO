Redistricting analysis tools (RDA)

This repository ([rdatools/rdatools](https://github.com/rdatools/rdatools)) contains redistricting analysis code. 
There are two associated repositories of data:

*   [rdatools/vtd_data](https://github.com/rdatools/vtd_data) &ndash; Various precinct-level input data for the analysis tools,
    where precincts are generally census VTDs except in a few states which use census blockgroups.
*   [rdatools/vtd_ensembles](https://github.com/rdatools/vtd_ensembles) &ndash; Various output data from the analysis tools,
    including ensembles of plans and scores for plans in ensembles.
