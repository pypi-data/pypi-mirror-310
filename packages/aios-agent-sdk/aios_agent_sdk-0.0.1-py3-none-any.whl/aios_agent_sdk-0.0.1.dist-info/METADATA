## ‚úàÔ∏è Getting Started
OpenAGI is used as the agent creation package to build agents for [AIOS](https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS).
### Installation
From PyPI
```
pip install pyopenagi
```
Locally
```
git clone https://agiresearch/OpenAGI
cd OpenAGI
pip install -e .
```

### Usage

#### Add a new agent
To add a new agent, first you need to create a folder under the pyopenagi/agents folder.
The folder needs to be the following structure:
```
- pyopenagi/agents
  - author
    - agent_name
      - agent.py # main code for the agent execution logic
      - config.json # set up configurations for agent
      - meta_requirements.txt # dependencies that the agent needs
```
If you want to use external tools provided by openagi in your agents, you can follow instructions of setting up tools in [How to setup external tools](./tools.md).
If you want to add new tools for your developing agent,
you need to add a new tool file in the [folder](./pyopenagi/tools/).

#### Upload agent
If you have developed and tested your agent, and you would like to share your agents, you can use the following to upload your agents
```
python pyopenagi/agents/interact.py --mode upload --agent <author_name/agent_name>
```
üí°Note that the `agent` param must exactly match the folder you put your agent locally.

#### Download agent
If you want to look at implementations of other agents that others have developed, you can use the following command:
```
python pyopenagi/agents/interact.py --mode download --agent <author_name/agent_name>
```
