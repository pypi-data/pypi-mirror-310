`genaibook`
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This package contains some utilities to support O’Reilly book [*Hands-On
Generative AI with Transformers and Diffusion
Models*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-generative-ai/9781098149239/)
([O’Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-generative-ai/9781098149239/),
[amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Generative-Transformers-Diffusion-Models/dp/1098149246/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)).

## Setup

Code is an essential part of the book content, and we highly recommend
to run the code examples while reading it. We also recommend to explore
on your own by modifying the code snippets or creating your own!

This package will help you setup your environment and provides some
basic utilities used throughout the book.

### Hardware and Software Requirements

`genaibook` only requires Python 3.10 or better. Dealing with
transformers and diffusion models is a compute-intensive task, so having
access to a computer with a NVIDIA GPU will be needed. There are
multiple online options that you can use such as [Google
Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [Kaggle
Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks).

You can also run in a local environment if your computer has a NVIDIA
GPU. Support for `mps` on Apple Silicon Macs is expected to work for the
most part, but has not been tested in depth.

### Local Environment

If you want to install in your computer, please install a Python 3.10
virtual environment using your preferred method. As an example, you can
do it with `conda` like this:

``` bash
conda create -n genaibook python=3.10
conda activate genaibook
```

### Package Install

If you are using your own local environment, just run the following in a
terminal window:

``` bash
pip install genaibook
```

If you are using a notebook-based environment such as [Google
Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Kaggle
Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks), enter the following
in the first cell of a new notebook:

``` bash
!pip install genaibook
```

This will in turn install `transformers`, `diffusers`, PyTorch and other
libraries used in the book.
