## Features

- Generates a Flask project with a predefined structure.
- Includes a sample HomeController and User model.
- Includes basic project setup with templates and static assets.
- Automatically creates the necessary directories and files.
- Simple command-line interface to create the project.

## Installation

flarevel create <project_name>
```

You can install the necessary dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the application

After generating the project, you can run it by executing the following command in the project directory:

```bash
python run.py
```

This will start the Flask development server, and you can view the project in your browser at http://localhost:5000

## Migration

- Initialize the Migration Directory
    ```bash

    ```

## Create Model

The `make:model` command allows you to easily create a new model file in your Flarevel project. It automatically generates a model with default fields (`id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) and a structure ready for customization.

### Usage

Run the following command in your project path terminal:

```bash
flarevel make:model ModelName
```

## Create Controller

The `make:controller` command allows you to easily create a new controller file in your Flarevel project. It supports creating controllers with directories, making it easy to organize your application into submodules.
