# Flarevel

`flarevel` is a Python command-line tool that helps you quickly create a Flask project with a predefined folder structure. It generates the necessary files for a basic Flask application with SQLAlchemy support, a home page, and a user model.

## Features

- Generates a Flask project with a predefined structure.
- Includes a sample HomeController and User model.
- Includes basic project setup with templates and static assets.
- Automatically creates the necessary directories and files.
- Simple command-line interface to create the project.

## Installation

To install `flarevel`, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install flarevel
```

## Usage

To create a new Flarevel project, simply run the following command:

```bash
flarevel create <project_name>
```

You can install the necessary dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the application

After generating the project, you can run it by executing the following command in the project directory:

```bash
python run.py
```

This will start the Flask development server, and you can view the project in your browser at http://localhost:5000


## Database Migration
The `migrate` command in Flarevel automates the process of handling database migrations. It uses Flask-Migrate under the hood to manage changes in the database schema.

### Usage

Run the following command in your project path terminal:

```bash
flarevel forge migrate
```

## Create Model

The `make:model` command allows you to easily create a new model file in your Flarevel project. It automatically generates a model with default fields (`id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) and a structure ready for customization.

### Usage

Run the following command in your project path terminal:

```bash
flarevel forge make:model ModelName
```

## Create Controller

The `make:controller` command allows you to easily create a new controller file in your Flarevel project. It supports creating controllers with directories, making it easy to organize your application into submodules.

### Usage

Run the following command in your project path terminal:

```bash
flarevel forge make:controller ControllerName
```
