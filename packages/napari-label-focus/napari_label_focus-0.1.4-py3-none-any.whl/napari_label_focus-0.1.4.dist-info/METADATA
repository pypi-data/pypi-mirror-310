# napari-label-focus

Easily focus the view on selected elements from a **Labels** layer to inspect them.

- The plugin works on 2D, 2D+time, 3D, and 4D images.
- The table shows the label index and volume (number of pixels) of each label.
- Click on the table rows to focus the view on the corresponding label.
- The table is updated when layers are added or removed from the viewer, selected from the dropdown, and when their data is modified.
- The table is sorted by volume (biggest object on top).
- You can save the table as a CSV file.
