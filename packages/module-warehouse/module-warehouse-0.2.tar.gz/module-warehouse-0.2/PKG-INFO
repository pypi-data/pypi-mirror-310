# Module Warehouse

**Module Warehouse** is a plugin for [NetBox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox) designed to manage and display modules stored in a virtual warehouse. This plugin simplifies the process of viewing all modules associated with a specific device representing a "warehouse" in NetBox.

## Features

- Displays a list of modules stored in the virtual warehouse device.
- Alphabetically sorts the modules by their type and ID.
- Simple setup and integration with NetBox.

## Requirements

- **NetBox**: Version 4.1 or higher
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher

## Installation

### 1. Install the plugin
Install the plugin from PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
pip install module-warehouse
```
### 2. Update `PLUGINS` in NetBox configuration
Add `module_warehouse` to the `PLUGINS` list in your `netbox/netbox/configuration.py` file:
```bash
PLUGINS = [
    "module_warehouse",
]
```

## Usage
Once the plugin is installed and configured:
1. Navigate to the Module Warehouse section in the NetBox menu.
2. If a device named `Sklad` (warehouse) exists:
    - The page will display all modules associated with this device, sorted alphabetically by their type.
3. If no device named `Sklad` exists:
    - A message will indicate that the warehouse is not currently configured.
